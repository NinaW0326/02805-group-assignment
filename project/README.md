The project of this course.


1. things need to hand-in
(a) A website. The website should contain your analysis, it should tell the story about the data that you're interested in getting across. The website should not be technical, but rather aim at using visualization and explanation to get your insights across to a non-scientific reader.

- no strong technical need, but creative would be better
- be self-contained & tell the story of your dataset

see this link for more information: https://github.com/SocialComplexityLab/socialgraphs2020/wiki/Project-Assignments

(b) An explainer Notebook. The Notebook should contain all the behind the scenes stuff, details on the dataset, why you've selected this particular dataset, explanations of your choices regarding network analysis, etc. You should link to the notebook from the site.


- The idea is that you can create much more complex, fun and interactive analysis (and visualizations) on line. So the website is a way for you to present your work in a way that everyone can understand it ... including dynamic visualizations, interactive analysis, etc, etc ... that would not work on a piece of paper. (Also, it'll hopefully be something cool you can show your friends <-- sorry, I know I'm a nerd).
