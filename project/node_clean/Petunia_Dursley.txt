During her childhood, she broke off contact with her sister and refused to have any contact with the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a>.
</p><p>She married a Muggle, <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon Dursley</a> and they had a son, <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley</a>. However, when Lily was murdered by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a>, Petunia became guardian of her nephew, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, who was only an infant then. She neglected and treated him cruelly for the most part, and confined him to sleep in the cupboard under the stairs (although she allowed him a room of his own after receiving his acceptance letters to Hogwarts in order to attempt to trick Hogwarts into not sending letters). In <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> came and said that Harry would go to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, she became very angry at the fact her nephew had discovered his true magical heritage.

Dumbledore responded saying that Petunia may not study at Hogwarts, and even though he responded kindly, Petunia felt hurt and left out, which also in part could have been because her parents were so proud of Lily's talents. From that point on, Petunia wanted nothing to do with magic or the wizarding world and frequently called Lily a "freak".<sup id="cite_ref-DH33_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH33-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

The child turned out to be her sister's son, Harry Potter. A letter had been left by Albus Dumbledore, explaining the circumstances of Harry's arrival, including the death of both her sister, <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily</a> and her brother-in-law, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a>.

She reluctantly agreed to take her orphaned nephew into her home and family, taking the responsibility to not tell Harry or anyone else about the fact that Harry was a wizard.
</p><p>Petunia, however, did not treat Harry as a welcome addition to her family. The boy‘s mere existence gave Petunia a constant reminder of her sister and the world she herself had been excluded from. She treated Harry poorly, even keeping him in the <a href="/wiki/Cupboard_Under_the_Stairs" title="Cupboard Under the Stairs">Cupboard Under the Stairs</a> as a bedroom for much of his childhood. She made a point of showering Dudley with gifts while completely ignoring Harry, although they were both around the same age. She forced him to do all of the chores around the house, while Dudley was free to do anything he pleased. Petunia also told Harry that his parents had died in a car crash and that the scar on his forehead came from that same accident. She did not let Harry ask any questions about his family, nor generally any questions at all for that matter.<sup id="cite_ref-PS2_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS2-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>

<p>When Harry's Hogwarts letter arrived in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>, she supported her husband's decision to keep the truth from Harry. They constantly tried to burn or rip up the letters, but they found that nothing was helping to stop the letters coming to Harry, so Petunia and the rest of the family moved to different places in an effort to outrun this wizarding post,<sup id="cite_ref-PS3_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS3-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> until finally they were tracked down by <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>.

</p><p>Over the next several years, Petunia still grudgingly permitted Harry to remain in her home over the summers, recharging the blood protections that kept him and her family safe from Voldemort throughout the rest of the year.

<p>During the summer of <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, Petunia and Vernon were suspicious of how Harry would constantly listen to the news, as they were ignorant of how Voldemort had <a href="/wiki/Return_of_Lord_Voldemort" title="Return of Lord Voldemort">returned</a>, and that Harry was listening to see if Voldemort would launch attacks upon the Muggle world. She and Vernon were also totally ignorant of their son's Dudley's anti-social behaviour with his gang in the neighbourhood, incorrectly believing he was having dinner with his friend's families instead.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP1_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP1-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>

She unintentionally revealed some knowledge of the wizarding world by telling Vernon what Dementors were. When asked how she knew, she said that she heard "<a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">that awful boy</a>" and Lily talking about them (although Harry assumed at the time that she was referring to his father, due to his ignorance of Snape's childhood friendship with his mother). When Vernon ordered Harry out of the house, she reluctantly stepped in after a <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore%27s_howler_to_Petunia_Dursley" title="Albus Dumbledore&#39;s howler to Petunia Dursley">howler</a> (later revealed to have been from Dumbledore) arrived telling Petunia to "<i>remember <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">my</a> last</i>." Petunia cloaked her decision to allow Harry to stay in characteristic motives — that she knew it would appear strange to the neighbours if Harry suddenly vanished. Whether this was the true reason for allowing her nephew to remain there or perhaps a glimmer of family loyalty was not clear.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP2_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP2-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>

Petunia was shown to be unpleasant and contemptuous even as a child, as she frequently insulted her sister as a "freak" due to her magical abilities and her sneering towards a young Severus Snape due to his shabby clothes and lower-class background.<sup id="cite_ref-DH33_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH33-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<p>At the heart of Petunia's character was her secret regret at having not been born a witch like her sister. As a child, Petunia was both frightened of and envious of her sister's astonishing abilities. She also heavily felt that her parent's favoured Lily over her, resulting in feelings of being ignored and unappreciated by them. When Lily was accepted into Hogwarts, Petunia wrote a letter to Professor Dumbledore begging him to take her as well. He rejected her kindly, but when Lily discovered the exchange, Petunia only said that she "<i>didn't want to go to that 'freak' school anyway</i>", when in reality she was very upset at realising she had no magical abilities herself. In addition, Petunia was understandably devastated upon learning of her sister's death, and had deep feelings of sadness inside her for never reconciling with her before she died.<sup id="cite_ref-DH33_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH33-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Petunia frequently referred to witches and wizards as "freaks". However, never did she forget that Harry was her sister's son. She begrudgingly gave him room and board for sixteen years because she knew that her home was the only place that he could be safe from the hands of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a>. Although she did feel some compassion and love for her nephew deep down, she was too repressed inside to ever express such emotions and was unable to say anything to him before they all departed from 4 Privet drive in 1997, showing she was never able to let go of her resentment.<sup id="cite_ref-DH3_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH3-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Due to having grown up with wizards, Petunia had a somewhat greater familiarity with magic than Vernon.

<p>It is unknown what kind of relationship Petunia has with her parents, though she seems resentful of them for keeping Lily and her special talents in high regard. Petunia may have felt left out or lesser in comparison to her sister (this may have contributed even more to her intense dislike of magic). It is known that they had died by the time Petunia had a son.
</p><p>Lily Evans was Petunia's only sibling. When Lily's magical abilities began to manifest themselves, Petunia was torn between curiosity and disapproval. Their relationship became even more strained when Lily became friends with <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, the very peculiar boy next door.
</p><p>When Lily was admitted to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, Petunia secretly wrote to <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Professor Dumbledore</a> begging him to let her attend as well. After being kindly rejected by him, Petunia began calling wizards and witches "weirdos" and denied the existence of her sister as much as possible. She would not admit it, but deep inside her, Petunia still cared for Lily, sending her sister a vase (however horrible in Lily's opinion) one <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> and was in all probability devastated when her sister was murdered. As James didn't have a family, it was Petunia who arranged the funeral for her sister and brother-in-law and had them buried in <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a>, and also took in their son, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, for his protection. In truth, Petunia may have wanted to make amends with her only sister, but to her everlasting regret meant she never got the chance. Her taking in of Harry was likely out of her regret for not having made up with her sister and did so to honour her sacrifice. 
</p><p>After being given Harry, Petunia kept Lily's blanket, in which he was wrapped, for the rest of her life as (aside from Harry) it was all of her sister she had left.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Petunia met Vernon Dursley at work and married him sometime later.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermore_2-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermore-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> She identified with his narrow-minded views and was proud of his position at work.

</p><p>They were extremely vain, materialistic, and preoccupied with status. They gave <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley</a> everything he wanted, allowing him to rule the house. Conversely, they kept strict control over Harry; he performed the chores, cooked the meals (or at least breakfast), and spent time otherwise locked in the cupboard under the stairs.

</p><p>It is unknown if Vernon knew that his wife wanted to attend <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> herself in the past, about her previously close relationship with Lily, or her childhood with the wizard <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>.

<p>Dudley was Petunia's first and only child. To say that Dudley was pampered and spoiled is an understatement. Petunia and her husband catered to Dudley's every whim and lavished affection on him while completely disregarding <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry</a>. They praised Dudley excessively, despite the fact that he rarely worked hard or achieved anything noteworthy (except perhaps his considerable boxing abilities, but even that was essentially an extension of his aggressive, bullying nature). Petunia never acknowledged when her son was in the wrong and overlooked his many flaws. As a result of her indulging Dudley's gluttony, he grew up extremely obese. However, Petunia, was in complete denial about her son's size and said that it was just "baby fat".
</p><p>Petunia was a poor parent because she cared more about indulging her son than teaching him how to be a good person and as a consequence, he grew up to be lazy, selfish and with no moral values. This fact came back to haunt Dudley when he encountered the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">dementors</a>.

<p>Petunia never showed any <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a> and affection at all towards Harry because he reminded her of <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily</a> and the wizarding world. She treated him as a waste of space, often abusing him, giving him the cupboard under the stairs at first and making him do all the chores. She, along with <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon</a>, ignored most of Harry's birthdays.
</p><p>She didn't accept Harry as a second son and never gave him the love and affection he needed and craved from her. She kept him entirely ignorant of the wizarding world and tried to make her family look as normal as possible, as part of her attempts to hide Harry from other people. When Harry left to search for <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a> in 1997, Petunia was almost able to bring herself to wish him luck and admit that her poor treatment of him was born out of jealousy, but backed out at the last moment and left without saying a word.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Harry was privy to many <a href="/wiki/Memory" title="Memory">memories</a> of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, after the latter's death at the fangs of <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a>, regarding his (Snape's) origins and loyalties. Many of the first memories that Harry had gazed upon depicted his future Aunt Petunia and unwittingly explained to him the reasons for her hatred of him and magic overall, such as: her falling out with his mother as children, Petunia's jealousy of Lily's <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> abilities and her childhood enmity with Snape. However, Harry was more concerned about discovering Snape's loyalties and origins than he was about decrypting Petunia's hatred for him.
</p><p>Petunia would later become an aunt-in-law to Harry's wife <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginevra Weasley</a> and a great-aunt to Harry and Ginny's three children; <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_II" title="James Potter II">James Sirius</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus Severus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lily_L._Potter" title="Lily L. Potter">Lily Luna</a>. Although Harry's relationship with Dudley had mended to the point that they remained on "Christmas card terms" and visited occasionally, it is unknown if Petunia herself ever had contact with Harry again. In spite of everything, Harry cared for her enough to push them to go into hiding for their protection. Although it is not known if Petunia contacted Harry again after the war, it is highly possible that Petunia reconciled with her nephew and was on Christmas cards terms with him too. Given how Harry learned of what caused the rift between his mother and her sister, Harry gained a new understanding of his aunt. After her death, Dudley gave Harry his blanket which had been kept in the possession of Petunia since his arrival at Privet Drive.

<p>Petunia first met Severus Snape during their childhood. She was the sister of <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily Evans</a>, but Petunia was a <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a>, unlike her sister. Snape and Petunia strongly disliked each other, from the first moment they met. Petunia, who was contemptuous of anything out of the ordinary, viewed him with disdain because of his poor economic status and because he was such an oddball. Snape, on the other hand, regarded her balefully because she was a Muggle and also because she made disparaging comments about his clothes. Possibly as a result of this childhood animosity, the subject of Snape, as with anything magic-related, was never mentioned under the <a href="/wiki/4_Privet_Drive" title="4 Privet Drive">Dursley's roof</a> until <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley Dursley</a> got attacked by dementors and he was indirectly mentioned by Petunia as "<i>that awful boy" </i>when talking about Dementors.
</p><p>In an ironic twist, Snape and Petunia's negative encounters helped shape their respective adult personalities. Snape's interactions with Petunia likely helped reinforce his already growing disdain for the Muggle world, which caused him to dabble in <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood_supremacy" title="Pure-blood supremacy">Pure-blood supremacy</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a> during his teenage years and early adulthood. Likewise, Petunia's encounters with Snape likely hardened her heart towards anything and anyone related to the wizarding world. In a cruel sense of irony, Snape's interests in the Dark Arts indirectly caused the death of Petunia's sister Lily.

<p>It can be assumed that Aunt Petunia would not have gotten on well with Albus Dumbledore due to his "unDursleyness" and due the fact that he was as unusual as it is possible to be. It was also he who alerted Petunia to the death of <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">her sister</a> and abandoned <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> on her doorstep shortly after, ignoring her feelings on the matter. After <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon Dursley</a> tried to throw Harry out after the attack on <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley Dursley</a>, Dumbledore sent Petunia an exploding, screaming letter (<a href="/wiki/Howler" title="Howler">howler</a>). Not even a year later Dumbledore arrived at <a href="/wiki/4_Privet_Drive" title="4 Privet Drive">4 Privet Drive</a> uninvited telling them that they had to let Harry stay until his 17th birthday for their protection, giving them drinks that constantly hit them in the head. It is unknown to how Petunia reacted to his death or if Harry, <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> or <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a> told her about his murder. Despite the kindness shown by Dumbledore to Petunia in his letter denying her a place at Hogwarts, she likely felt a sense of bitterness towards him for a number of years.

<p>Petunia is the name of a flower. Her younger sister, Lily, also bears the name of a flower. This could have been done accidentally or by means of demonstrating Petunia's and Lily's sisterhood. A petunia is also a flower that is a symbol of resentment and anger. Petunia was a name J.K. Rowling used for unpleasant female characters in games in her youth, and believes the name may have subconsciously came from <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_and_Petunia" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Joe and Petunia">Joe and Petunia</a></i>, a series of public information films she would have seen in her youth.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Petunia flowers themselves are used to represent resentment, along with anger. The alternative meaning is wanting the comfort of another person<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>, which is lightly implied when she asks to attend Hogwarts with her sister. It should also be noted that the flower is known for not smelling particularly good<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>. 
</p><p>Petunia's maiden name was Evans. <i>Evans</i> is a Welsh or English surname derived from the given name <i>Evan</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> As a Welsh name, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Evan">Evan</a> means "young warrior". It can also be considered a form of the name <i>John</i>, meaning "God is gracious".<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Petunia's married surname is Dursley. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dursley" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Dursley">Dursley</a> is a town in Gloucestershire, England. <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> has commented that she visited the place as a child and hated it, which likely affected her choice of surname for the awful family, remarking "I don't imagine I'm very popular in Dursley".<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> The town is known for its Victorian history in coal mining. Rowling chose the name because it sounded "dull and forbidding".

<ul><li>The role of Petunia is played by <a href="/wiki/Fiona_Shaw" title="Fiona Shaw">Fiona Shaw</a> in the film adaptations of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (film)">Philosopher's Stone</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, as well as <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>.
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Ariella_Paradise" title="Ariella Paradise">Ariella Paradise</a> portrays the young Petunia Evans in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Her appearance in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)" title="Harry Potter (film series)">films</a> is somewhat different than the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(book_series)" title="Harry Potter (book series)">books</a>, where she is described as being <i>"blonde and horse-toothed."</i> In the films, however, she has dark brown hair and normal teeth.</li>
<li>In a deleted scene in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>, Petunia is seen looking very solemn, standing in the middle of the empty living room at <a href="/wiki/Privet_Drive" title="Privet Drive">Privet Drive</a>. Harry walks down the stairs and stops when he sees her. She says that she has lived in this house for twenty years, and now she's expected to leave in one night. Harry explains how <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">they</a> will torture her, and stop at nothing. Petunia replies that she knows what they are capable of, that night at <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a>, Harry didn't just lose a mother, Petunia lost a <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">sister</a>. After which, she hurries out the door. This is very likely what Petunia was going to say in the book, but chose not to.</li>
<li>Petunia was the first female character to be introduced in the series, though in the films it is <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>.</li>
<li>Since Petunia's sister, <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily</a>, was a Muggle-born witch, both girls must have a wizarding ancestry, however distantly. This means that Petunia was still related to wizards, even if she pretended she did not have a sister.</li>
<li>Rowling has said that Petunia's name may have come from a character in a public information film that she saw when she was a child.</li>
<li>As a child, Petunia went with Lily to Platform 9 ¾ when Lily left for Hogwarts. However, in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i>, when Harry asks her and Vernon about Platform 9 ¾, she apparently has no idea where it is or how to find it. Either she forgot where it was, or more likely she pretended not to know anything about it to antagonise Harry.</li>
<li>Coincidentally, there is a character from <i>Marvel Comics </i>by the name of "Aunt Petunia", and she is the aunt of the Fantastic Four member The Thing. Unlike Petunia Dursley however, this character does not appear to be abusive or disdainful of her nephew, as the Thing often proudly describes himself as "Aunt Petunia's favourite nephew".</li></ul>
