He became an ardent follower of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> in order to become a <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizard</a> in his teenage years.<sup id="cite_ref-joined_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-joined-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  He was the first escapee of <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> prison in its almost 300 year history, though only his <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">father</a>, late mother and the family house-elf knew until 1994, when it was revealed to <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> whilst Crouch was under the influence of <a href="/wiki/Veritaserum" title="Veritaserum">Veritaserum</a>. 
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a>, shortly after Voldemort's first defeat, Crouch allegedly participated in the <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Frank_and_Alice_Longbottom" title="Attack on Frank and Alice Longbottom">capture and torture</a> of <a href="/wiki/Frank_Longbottom" title="Frank Longbottom">Frank</a> and <a href="/wiki/Alice_Longbottom" title="Alice Longbottom">Alice Longbottom</a> along with the <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_family" title="Lestrange family">Lestranges</a>, using the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> to drive the two <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> to insanity. Crouch and his comrades were sentenced to life imprisonment in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for their crimes by his own father.
</p><p>Crouch and his parents hatched a plot under which Crouch's mother would take his place in Azkaban, using the <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a> to disguise herself. She died and was buried in Azkaban, with the result that the wizarding world believed that Crouch himself was dead. Crouch spent the following years living under his father's <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>. He eventually broke free with the help of Voldemort, who had learned that Crouch was still alive, making him enter the Dark Lord's service again.
</p><p>He then disguised himself as <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>, former Auror and the new <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor at Hogwarts during the <a href="/wiki/1994%E2%80%931995_school_year" title="1994–1995 school year">1994–1995 school year</a>. In this role, Crouch fixed the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a> so that <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> was chosen as a champion, and turned the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Cup" title="Triwizard Cup">Triwizard Cup</a> into a <a href="/wiki/Portkey" title="Portkey">Portkey</a> that transported Harry and <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> to Voldemort. Shortly afterwards, his identity was exposed, and Crouch was given the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a> by a <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementor</a> that <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> had brought along with him.

<p>Barty's father chose to make a public example of his son, and sentenced him to a term of life imprisonment in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> at the age of eighteen or nineteen. According to <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, the trial was no more than an excuse to show how much the father hated the child, as the elder Crouch went as far as to drown out his son's voice by shouting the announcement of sentencing, and Barty was screaming inside his cell for his mother for the first few days, but then quieted down from the extreme depressive influence of the Dementors, as did many other prisoners. Barty already looked in poor health when he was brought in, as Sirius described.<sup id="cite_ref-GF30_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GF30-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Upon entering Hogwarts' <a href="/wiki/Start-of-Term_Feast" title="Start-of-Term Feast">Start-of-Term Feast</a> with Moody's appearance, he received applause only from Dumbledore and Hagrid, both of whom stopped quickly after realising that absolutely nobody else clapped, as everyone was too fixated on Barty's scarred facade.

</p><p>Barty used his time at Hogwarts to gain the trust of the students and staff at Hogwarts. During his first lesson for a group of <a href="/wiki/Fourth_year" title="Fourth year">fourth year</a> students, he demonstrated all three <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curses</a> on three different spiders<sup id="cite_ref-GF14_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GF14-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> and controversially, later also the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a> on the students themselves, although he claimed to have had permission to do so, in order to teach them how to overcome it. As a teacher, Barty (under the guise as Alastor) was actually quite effective. Despite his ulterior motives, his teaching of how to overcome curses such as the Imperius was valuable with Harry Potter, who gained the ability to resist even Lord Voldemort himself as a result of this training. He was also a strict teacher, as he kept his students working until the end of the classes despite most of them being distracted by the Christmas festivities.

<p>When Harry escaped the graveyard and returned to Hogwarts, Barty ushered him away from the panicking crowd to interrogate him about Voldemort's return. He revealed to Harry that it was he all along who guided him through the Tournament; he put his name in the <a href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a>, got <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> to show the dragons, explained the <a href="/wiki/Golden_egg" title="Golden egg">Golden egg</a> to Cedric knowing he would tell Harry, bewitched <a href="/wiki/Viktor_Krum" title="Viktor Krum">Viktor Krum</a> and stunned <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a>. Barty then planned on killing Harry and being honoured above the rest of Voldemort's followers.
</p><p>But before he could, Albus, accompanied by Minerva and Severus, fired a <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">Stunning Spell</a> at him, having realised that he was not Alastor when he removed Harry from his sight — his one slip-up. After the Polyjuice Potion wore off, Barty confessed everything to Albus under the influence of <a href="/wiki/Veritaserum" title="Veritaserum">Veritaserum</a>, a strong truth potion.
</p><p>However, before he could testify before the Wizengamot, Barty suffered a fate worse than death, receiving the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a> by a <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementor</a> that <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a> <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> brought with him.

<dd>&#8212;Barty to <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a><sup class="noprint"><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">[src]</a></sup></dd>
<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>Barty was shown to have been intensely hateful, diabolical, scheming, evil, vengeful, cold, cruel, manipulative, callous, loyal, extremely intelligent, sadistic, shadowy, very arrogant, cunning, selfish and ruthless. He was obviously a rather powerful wizard, having demonstrated sufficient magical ability to Confound the <a href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a> into believing that four schools participated in the Triwizard Tournament in order for Harry to participate in the contest despite the object's power. Barty was also perceptively observant and exceptionally manipulative; his keen attention to the habits and motivations of others enabled him to impersonate <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a> so accurately that he even managed to fool <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-GF35_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GF35-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Dangerously clever and fearsomely determined, Bartemius proved capable of orchestrating the events of the Triwizard Tournament so that Harry Potter would be transported to Voldemort, in order to ensure his master's return. Barty's high intelligence also made him bitingly cynical and he remarked how easy some people were to manipulate — he <i>was</i> capable of concern for his plans, and expressed his fear that Harry would have failed the Second Task. He also expressed frustration for how slowly Harry progressed in Barty's plans, citing Harry's weakness of pride as the reason.
</p><p>Barty was extremely devoted to Voldemort and regarded him as a father figure. His loyalty was matched only by fellow Death Eater <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>. He also seemed to know much of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Snr" class="mw-redirect" title="Tom Riddle Snr">Voldemort's father</a>, comparing him with his own father. This may imply that Barty was aware of Voldemort's status of being <a href="/wiki/Half-blood" title="Half-blood">half-blood</a>, but did not care, in contradiction to the Death Eaters' belief of <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-blood</a> supremacy, or that Voldemort simply superseded the blood status. However, Barty's immense loyalty to Voldemort blinded him to those who truly <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">loved</a> him, namely <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior%27s_mother" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior&#39;s mother">his mother</a> and the family's devoted house-elf <a href="/wiki/Winky" title="Winky">Winky</a>. They sacrificed much to give him a second chance at a happy life, which Barty tragically wasted in his obsession to reunite with Voldemort. As with many other Death Eaters, Barty had deluded himself into believing that he alone understood Voldemort, and that they were closest to each other due to their commons, to which was in fact not true as Voldemort never desired a friend nor understood human affections.
</p><p>One reason for Barty's behaviour may be the fact that his <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">father</a> neglected him during his childhood and/or teenage years, and later forced him to spend years under the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a> in relative isolation, possibly affecting his mental stability. The year he spent in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> also furthered his mental decline, due to the effects of the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a>. He was also likely very sadistic, not only did he participate in torturing the Longbottoms, but forced their son <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> to watch a demonstration of the Cruciatus Curse on a spider, despite the latter's bizarre and panicked response. However, this latter act could have been what the real Moody would have done himself, and possibly it was indeed to teach the students the harsh truths about the Curses.
</p><p>Crouch also loved <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> in his youth, a fact mentioned by Winky. Also, as a young man, he was extremely emotional, weeping and screaming before he was sent to the Dementors and pleading violently with his father to grant him leniency. He screamed constantly in Azkaban — but this can be supremely expected among the prisoners of Dementors. He was prominently hypocritical, and snarled at the Death Eaters for hiding and refusing to brave Azkaban in Voldemort's name, when this is exactly what he can be accused of also.
</p><p>Barty was one of the only known wizards to call Voldemort by his name 'Voldemort' instead of using 'the Dark Lord' or a different version of it, saying his name while talking to Harry after the Third Task. He was also the only known <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a> to do so; even defectors such as <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Regulus_Black" title="Regulus Black">Regulus Black</a> referred to Voldemort as "the Dark Lord", while fellow fanatically loyal Death Eater Bellatrix saw it as a sign of respect not to speak the name.
</p><p>Crouch also seems to detest cowardice, such as when <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> attempted to attack Harry from behind after the latter had insulted him, Crouch (still under disguised as Moody) angrily <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">transfigured</a> Draco into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Ferret" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:en:Ferret">ferret</a> and continuously taunted him over his under-handed tactics, and subsequently yelled at Draco about stories about his father that would make him shiver with fear, hinting that while sadistic and ruthless, Crouch was a fair wizard.

<p>Barty Crouch was very gifted and intelligent, whose potential as a wizard could be matched by only a select few. Armed with only the magical skills he had acquired throughout seven years of Hogwarts education, he successfully demonstrated sufficient magical ability to fool a whole school of learned academicians into believing him to be a seasoned Auror, speaking for his considerable skills. Additionally, Crouch swiftly came up with a feasible strategy to help <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> win the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a> after he placed the boy's name into the <a href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a>.

During his <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Magical_Law" title="Council of Magical Law">Council of Magical Law</a> trial, Crouch feigned innocence by crying for his parents, hiding his loyalty to Voldemort, and even maintaining such an act during his first days in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>. This affected public opinion later, when they pitied the young man for his father's harsh and uncaring treatment. During his infiltration of Hogwarts, Crouch pulled off the role of <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a> so convincingly, that he managed to deceive everyone around him, including <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, earning their trust and putting them into good use. He played the role of a friendly mentor to <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, and also abstained himself from attacking any former <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a>) within his range, instead using Moody's reputation as an extremely accomplished Auror to intimidate them. Crouch was even able to act his way out of an unforeseen complication of Harry seeing him on the <a href="/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" title="Marauder&#39;s Map">Marauder's Map</a> in Snape's office, by claiming that it had been <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">Bartemius Crouch Senior</a>, looking for <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizard</a> evidence inside the Potions professor's office. However, Crouch's acting skills were still imperfect, as shown when after Voldemort had been resurrected, Crouch foolishly took Harry away from Dumbledore to kill him, so he would be honoured even more by Voldemort, which was something the real Moody would never do, allowing Dumbledore to finally realise that Crouch has been impersonating Moody.</li></ul>

<p>Crouch Jnr's father, as a high-ranking <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a> official, spent his entire life dedicated to <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement">eradicating</a> the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark</a> forces, and as such, didn't pay enough attention to his own son. When Crouch Jnr was caught with other <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> at the crime scene of <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">torture</a> of <a href="/wiki/Alice_Longbottom" title="Alice Longbottom">Alice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Longbottom" title="Frank Longbottom">Frank Longbottom</a> to insanity, his father's parental affection extended to as much as giving him a trial, something he did not always give other suspects. In the end, the trial was merely to make an example out of his own son, and to publicly disown him, making clear he had nothing to do with anyone who would even remotely be connected to the committing of such a horrible crime. Crouch Snr mercilessly sentenced his own son to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for life. 
</p><p>A little over a year later, the father, as a favour for his <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior%27s_mother" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior&#39;s mother">dying wife</a>, smuggled him out of prison and kept him under control with the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a> for years to come. By Crouch Jnr's claim, his father loved only his wife and not him, but this was only in his own perception. The elder Barty's willingness to sacrifice his wife to spend her last days in the horrific Azkaban to rescue their son may be indicating that he retained some paternal affection for him, despite many believed otherwise. It was this sentence that cost Crouch Snr his chance to become <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a>, his position as Head of the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement">Department of Magical Law Enforcement</a>, and his wife to suffer her last few days in Azkaban. It was also this sentence that caused Barty Snr to be demoted to the Head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation. When the elder Crouch was subjugated by Voldemort and escaped, he decided to tell Dumbledore of everything, including that he smuggled his own son out of prison; it was during this moment that Crouch (in a delusive state) expressed his regret to Harry Potter of mistreating and neglecting his son, blaming himself for the young man's choice of life.
</p><p>Crouch Jnr, in turn, hated his father, considering him to be a very disappointing parent. Being sent to Azkaban for one year and imprisoned in his own mind for twelve only increased the friction between father and son. Crouch also claimed that he suffered the indignity of being named after his father and had the "great pleasure" of finally murdering him. Adding insult to injury, he transfigured his father's body into a bone and buried it, showing callous, but understandable disrespect for the corpse with a crude method of disposing it.

<p>His <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior%27s_mother" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior&#39;s mother">mother</a> loved him very much, and persuaded her husband to help him escape <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>. He also apparently had some affection for his mother as it is revealed that he was "screaming for his mother" during his early days in Azkaban. She was about to die when her son was imprisoned, so she drank <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a> and disguised as him to take his place at Azkaban. She died a short time later, and was buried outside Azkaban. However, rather than start afresh and repent for his crimes, he tried to use the opportunity to look for Lord Voldemort and help bring him back to power, apparently his year in prison and hatred for his father caused him to forget his love for his mother, tragically wasting all of her efforts for him.

Winky spent months to persuade Crouch Snr to let his son attend the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, and tried to suppress her acrophobia in order to keep an eye on the hidden convict.

</p><p>Crouch Jnr, on the other hand, thought that Winky's motherly nature was only out of pity and magic-bound duty. He launched the Dark Mark in the camp-site in order to scare disloyal Death Eaters, ignoring her efforts to keep him safe and hidden. He also showed no reciprocating affection for her as he ungratefully used her affections to achieve his goal of serving the Dark Lord, and gave a maniacal smile during his interrogation while she was there, the latter terrifying her.

<p>In contrast with his real father, Crouch saw Lord Voldemort as a father figure of sorts, and after having been disowned by his own father, was fanatically devoted to him. In fact, at that point, Crouch was willing to sacrifice and give absolutely everything to serve the Dark Lord. He also believed that if he finished off <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, he would be welcomed back, closer than a real son and honoured beyond his dreams. In essence, Barty's loyalty is only matched by fellow Death Eater <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>.
</p><p>Crouch's loyalty had  led him to know many things about Lord Voldemort that even other loyal Death Eaters, such as Bellatrix, presumably do not. Barty knew  that Voldemort had a <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">disappointing father</a>, that he suffered the indignity of being named after that father, and that he had the great pleasure of killing his father to ensure the rise of the dark order.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF_14-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> These three common threads helped to fuel Barty's loyalty. This also implies that Barty was  aware of Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Blood_status" title="Blood status">blood status</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Half-blood" title="Half-blood">half-blood</a>, but did not  care,  in contradiction to the Death Eaters' belief of <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-blood</a> supremacy. 
</p><p>It could very well be that Voldemort told Barty these similarities between the two and used them as a way to get Barty to join him. Voldemort could have simply told Barty about his father being disappointing while neglecting to reveal that Tom Riddle Snr was a Muggle. Voldemort seems to have acknowledged Barty's worth, something his own father failed to do, referring to Barty as "<i>his most faithful servant</i>". However, for all of Voldemort's public claims, he never truly cared for Barty any more than as a useful servant who is as easily disposable as any other, as Voldemort never wanted a friend. Although it is likely that he missed him for his usefulness and complete loyalty.

<p>Eventually Barty held a violent hatred towards the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> who had abandoned faith in Lord Voldemort. He believed that those who would not brave Azkaban for him and denied their affiliation with him were unforgivable—apparently having completely forgotten that he was once like that himself as he screamed his innocence in the courtroom. Barty practically begged Harry to tell him that Voldemort punished the Death Eaters for their thirteen years of disloyalty, to hurt them for their lack of faith.
</p><p>Due to this fanatical loyalty held by Barty, he <a href="/wiki/Morsmordre" title="Morsmordre">launched</a> the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> into the <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a> <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_World_Cup" title="Quidditch World Cup">Quidditch World Cup</a> to frighten the Death Eaters who were <a href="/wiki/Levicorpus" title="Levicorpus">levitating</a> the <a href="/wiki/Roberts_family" title="Roberts family">Roberts family</a> for fun, in retribution for their faithlessness, despite the risk of being caught. Also, during the year he was <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">disguised</a> as <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>, he spent a great deal of time intimidating former Death Eaters, <a href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a> and <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, relishing the thought of being alone with them to kill them. This intimidation extended to <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, the son of another disloyal Death Eater, <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a>. It's likely that he respected <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Rodolphus_Lestrange" title="Rodolphus Lestrange">Rodolphus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rabastan_Lestrange" title="Rabastan Lestrange">Rabastan</a> for their own loyalties to Voldemort.
</p><p>Despite his hatred towards them, Barty knew how to control his temper when necessary, and prevented himself from attacking them during his disguise as Moody. He even set aside his differences with <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a>, one of the most disloyal Death Eaters, and the one responsible for Voldemort's initial downfall due to the information given about the whereabouts of the <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">Potter family</a>, in order to work together to <a href="/wiki/Regeneration_potion" title="Regeneration potion">revive</a> the Dark Lord. Though it's also possible that he appreciated Pettigrew's role in finding their master in the first place, as well as helping to free him from his father's Imperius Curse, Pettigrew's neglect of guarding Crouch Snr may have nevertheless left another negative thought from Barty. Peter on the other hand seemed somewhat resentful that Voldemort compared him unfavourably to Barty in terms of skill and loyalty.

<p>Although <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> was Voldemort's most hated enemy, Barty never showed open hatred for him, though this is assumed to have been an act. After Barty became more paranoid and fanatically loyal to Voldemort, Voldemort and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> found Barty at his house. Voldemort freed Barty from the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a> and they plotted to murder Harry. Barty was the one who put Harry's name into the <a href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a>, while disguised as <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>. However, Barty didn't show that he was a <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a>, and played the role of a friendly teacher towards Harry, giving him useful information about how to succeed in the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. He was also the one who taught the <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curses</a> to Harry, and the first person Harry saw performing the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a> (besides Voldemort murdering <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily</a>). Over the year Barty taught Harry, he kept the boy safe from harm, and chased away other people who would threaten or get in the boy's way, all for him to serve Voldemort's plan. Harry also saw Barty's trial in the <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>, and was told by <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> that it was unknown if Barty was guilty or innocent. It could be that the only reason Barty desired Harry's death was to appease his master, and held no personal grudge. In fact, Barty seemed delighted when Harry proved to be able to throw off the Imperius curse in class, however, this is ultimately debatable, and could have just been part of Barty's act. However, when Crouch exposed himself, he did state how annoyed he was at Harry's pride being a setback for the plan, which forced Crouch to improvise to compensate.
</p><p>Barty helped Harry with the Tasks of the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, because he had turned the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Cup" title="Triwizard Cup">Triwizard Cup</a> into a <a href="/wiki/Portkey" title="Portkey">Portkey</a> in order to finalise the plan to <a href="/wiki/Return_of_Lord_Voldemort" title="Return of Lord Voldemort">resurrect Voldemort and eliminate Harry once and for all</a>. When Harry and Cedric Diggory touched it, they were transported to the <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton_graveyard" title="Little Hangleton graveyard">Little Hangleton graveyard</a>. Cedric was murdered by Peter Pettigrew immediately, but Harry fought Voldemort and escaped. After that, Barty attempted to murder Harry, but failed, being caught by Albus Dumbledore, <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>. Barty told them the story of his imprisonment, his escape and his return to Lord Voldemort (he was under Veritaserum at the time). He also told them that Voldemort would honour him as none other Death Eater. After that, Harry learned that Barty was given the Dementor's Kiss, which gave Harry a chill in the stomach at the thought.

<p>Albus Dumbledore was one of the participants in Barty's <a href="/wiki/Council_of_Magical_Law" title="Council of Magical Law">Council of Magical Law</a> trial. Dumbledore, like all of the participants, agreed to send Barty and his fellow <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> forever. He was also shocked by what Barty did to the <a href="/wiki/Longbottom_family" title="Longbottom family">Longbottoms</a> in <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a>. Barty was disguised as Moody and went to Hogwarts, while planning to send Harry Potter to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a>. During the time Barty lived at Hogwarts along with Dumbledore, Barty used Occlumency in order to prevent Dumbledore from learning who Moody really was.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, after <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> returned to Hogwarts from the <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton" title="Little Hangleton">Little Hangleton</a> <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton_graveyard" title="Little Hangleton graveyard">graveyard</a>, Barty told Dumbledore that he would go along with Harry in his office, despite the latter's insistence that he not. In fact, Barty wanted to kill Harry and learn what had happened at the Graveyard. Dumbledore realised that he wasn't the real Moody, knowing that the genuine Moody would never have removed Harry from Dumbledore's sight after having been told not to, and ran at Barty's office. Dumbledore stunned Barty just as he was going to kill Harry. Harry noted that Dumbledore was in such a fury, that his eyes seemed like having a blue flame, and Harry realised why Dumbledore was considered the one wizard Voldemort always feared. Dumbledore was disgusted by Barty's patricide, as well as abusing and ignoring the love his mother and Winky gave him, and bound him up for it. After Barty's exposure, Dumbledore learned that he was given the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a>, and noted to the Minister that this was a poor move due to the destruction of a valuable piece of evidence, showing he still had some pity for what Barty became as it also meant the Crouch family blood line was permanently ended.

<ul><li>The name Bartemius originates from the Biblical name Bartimaeus, who was permanently blind all his life, until Jesus healed him. Being named after his father, the reasons for naming after a blind man may be due to the fact Bartemius was quite oblivious to his mother's and house-elf's love. It may also reflect his blind devotion to Voldemort.</li>
<li>The name "Bartimaeus" means "son of honour"; a fitting name for the son of a man who placed his own honour before his son's life.</li>
<li>The surname Crouch is a variation of the <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">English</a> surname Cross. Whereas in the case of Barty Crouch Snr it may refer to his brutality against criminals, as the cross was a gibbet, in the case of his son this may refer to the Cruciatus Curse he supposedly used on the Longbottoms.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Although Barty received the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a> and had his soul removed in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, it is unknown when his body died.
<ul><li>He is also the only character who is known to have suffered the Dementor's Kiss, though it is said there have been other victims as the kiss was explained to Harry by Remus in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">The Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>.</li>
<li>His Kiss has never been portrayed for an audience to see.</li>
<li>Additionally, the Kiss is never mentioned in the films. Instead, it is implied that Crouch Jnr was sent back to Azkaban by order of Albus Dumbledore, with Severus Snape holding him at wand-point to keep him quiet. Crouch doesn't fear this as he believes, probably inaccurately, that he'll be welcomed back like a hero, and he is never mentioned again in the films.</li>
<li>Even though the Kiss is not shown, it still happened anyway, since there are no contradictions to the book about people’s fates even though they are not shown. It is implied in the later films however, that it did happen when Voldemort broke his Death Eaters out of Azkaban and Crouch Jnr did not appear.</li></ul></li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_1-4" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</a></i>, Barty hides behind a rock and casts the Dark Mark.</li>
<li>Barty Crouch Jnr was played by actor <a href="/wiki/David_Tennant" title="David Tennant">David Tennant</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i>. However, <a href="/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson" title="Brendan Gleeson">Brendan Gleeson</a> plays most of the role, as he is the actor who portrays Moody. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Walliams" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:David Walliams">David Walliams</a> was offered the role but turned it down due to scheduling conflicts with the third season of <i>Little Britain</i>.<sup class="noprint">&#91;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs references to reliable sources." style="white-space: nowrap;">citation needed</span></i></a>&#93;</sup></li>
<li>Barty's appearance in the film differs drastically from his looks in the book. In the book, he has sandy hair and is more lined but in the film, he has brown hair, and is not depicted as being a teenager in his trial, as <a href="/wiki/David_Tennant" title="David Tennant">David Tennant</a> plays the role here.</li>
<li>Barty's role in the film <i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> differs from the book. In the film, he is sentenced for the same crime as the book but, unlike in the book, it was based on <a href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a>'s testimony. Unlike in the book, once caught, there is no doubt of his guilt or <a href="/wiki/Insanity" title="Insanity">insanity</a>. He does not attempt to deny his guilt, nor does he beg his father to acquit him. Instead, he unsuccessfully tries to escape from the court room, but he is stopped by Alastor Moody with a white spell and then arrested by <a href="/wiki/Ministry_Police" title="Ministry Police">Ministry Police</a>. After being brought in front of his father, he sarcastically greets him in a show of defiance. He was also implied to have somehow escaped from Azkaban (with his father not even being aware of his son's escape, let alone playing any role in it), and appears in Harry's vision of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> and Wormtail in <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton" title="Little Hangleton">Little Hangleton</a>. After the Quidditch World Cup, Harry actually sees Barty create the Dark Mark, but does not know who he is due to being unable to make out Barty's face in the dark. Barty approaches Harry in order to capture him, but flees when his father and the Aurors arrive.
<ul><li>On a related note, Barty Jnr in the film was seen trying to slip away as his father is demanding that Karkaroff divulge the identity of the other Death Eater, apparently anticipating that Karkaroff was referring to him, but was unable to leave before Karkaroff blurted out the name.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the film there is no mention that he hates Death Eaters who lost the faith in Voldemort.</li>
<li>It seems strange that Barty, when disguised as Alastor Moody, asks Harry if Voldemort punished the <i>"cowards who wouldn't even brave Azkaban for him"</i>, and those who denied that they had ever even worked for him,<sup id="cite_ref-GF35_17-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GF35-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> when he himself did those two things,<sup id="cite_ref-GF30_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GF30-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> and ended up screaming for his mother at the first few days of his imprisonment. There are several possible reasons for this apparent discontinuity:
<ul><li>Crouch, a manipulative man and clearly a convincing actor (he was able to convincingly pose as Alastor Moody for over nine months), was trying to escape prison to resume searching for Voldemort.</li>
<li>Barty, like virtually everyone else in Wizarding Britain, feared Azkaban, and the knowledge of his impending lifetime conviction (as well as the six Dementors in the room at the time) caused him to lose his nerve.</li>
<li>Due to his time in Azkaban, not to mention the years he subsequently spent under the Imperius curse, Barty may have simply gone insane, and disregarded his own actions.</li>
<li>It should be noted, however, that at no point during his trial does Barty actually deny being a Death Eater. He simply denied being involved in torturing the Longbottoms (he specifically cries out <i>"I wasn't involved!"</i>), and begged his father not to send him back to the Dementors.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the film version, Barty Crouch Jnr has the habit of licking his lips when threatened, in a snake-like way, to which he occasionally shows while under the disguise of Alastor Moody. This habit led to him giving himself away to his father following the second task of the Triwizard Tournament.
<ul><li>The snake-like licking of his lips was improvised by David Tennant himself and is followed by Brendan Gleeson, when Barty is disguised as Mad-Eye Moody.<sup class="noprint">&#91;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs references to reliable sources." style="white-space: nowrap;">citation needed</span></i></a>&#93;</sup></li></ul></li>
<li>In the films, anyone who takes Polyjuice Potion has their voice remain the same, the only change being in appearance (to help avoid confusing the audience because of this change). This does not seem to be the case for Barty Crouch Jnr when he turns into Alastor Moody, however it does not seem impossible that Barty was imitating Moody's voice the entire time, or that the filmmakers decided to make this an exception since his transformation was kept secret (unlike the others that occurred throughout the films) and therefore the audience would not be aware beforehand until his identity was exposed at the end of the film (though it is notable that Crouch Jnr, without by Polyjuice, only had three lines before his exposure and was not identified, so the change in voice might not have been necessary for someone who hasn't seen <i>Goblet of Fire</i> before).</li>
<li>Barty Crouch Jnr was the first person to escape Azkaban, not Sirius Black (although Black was the first to do it on his own). Black's escape was discovered immediately after it was done, leading to this misconception.</li>
<li>Crouch thought that killing Harry would please Voldemort. In fact, Voldemort would have been furious, since he repeatedly stated that only he would kill Harry.</li>
<li>Ironically, considering his fanatical loyalty to Voldemort, Crouch's lessons on the Imperius Curse's effects while disguised as Moody are what allowed Harry to ultimately resist Voldemort's attempts at using the Imperius curse later on.</li>
<li>In the book Barty changes back into himself because he was unable to take the Polyjuice Potion in time due to being knocked out by Dumbledore and Snape earlier. In the film he runs out of potion, which also causes him to blow his cover by nervously asking Harry about graveyard, despite Harry never mentioning graveyard in the first place.</li>
<li>Coincidentally, the first episode of <i>Doctor Who</i> in which David Tennant portrays the <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Tenth_Doctor" class="extiw" title="w:c:tardis:Tenth Doctor">Tenth Doctor</a> is called "<a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/The_Parting_of_the_Ways_(TV_story)" class="extiw" title="w:c:tardis:The Parting of the Ways (TV story)">The Parting of the Ways</a>". The last chapter in which Barty appears in the book is also called "The Parting of the Ways". The amount of time the characters appear is also very similar. Crouch appears for the first page of the book's chapter, and the Tenth Doctor appears in the final scene of the <i>Doctor Who</i> episode. Furthering the comparison, both scenes feature Tennant appearing after a character changes their appearance, and end with him dressed in a battered leather jacket and black jumper, displaying somewhat maniacal tendencies.
<ul><li><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> was released in the UK the same day Tennant made his first solo appearance as the Doctor in a "mini-episode" that aired as part of the 2005 Children in Need Appeal TV special.</li>
<li>A later David Tennant episode <a href="https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/The_Shakespeare_Code_(TV_story)" class="extiw" title="w:c:tardis:The Shakespeare Code (TV story)">The Shakespeare Code</a> would contain several references to Harry Potter and JK Rowling. In particular, Tennant's character would comment on loving <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> which had not yet come out when the episode aired and <i><a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Expeliarmus</a></i> was used to defeat the bad guys.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/David_Bradley" title="David Bradley">David Bradley</a> would later take on the role of the first incarnation of the Doctor in 2017, after having played the character's original actor, William Hartnell, in the 2013 telefilm, <i>An Adventure in Space and Time</i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i>, Neville Longbottom gives Harry the gillyweed, instead of Dobby (who is absent in the film).</li></ul>
