<p>The Warlock met the <a href="/wiki/Maiden_(The_Warlock%27s_Hairy_Heart)" class="mw-redirect" title="Maiden (The Warlock&#39;s Hairy Heart)">maiden</a> who answered his every wish the day she arrived in the neighbourhood to visit her kinsfolk. Despite the fact that he felt nothing for her, the Warlock considered her as the prize he sought, and started to court her. He invites the young maiden to a feast in his castle, in which he speaks to her using sweet and caring words the got from a poet, meanings of which he has no idea. She accepted his invitation, even though she was fascinated and repulsed at him, and confronts him saying that she would only believe the lovely words if he proved he had a heart. The Warlock then took her to the deepest dungeon to show his most valuable treasure, his own beating heart. The maiden was terrified by the shrunken, hair-covered heart, and told the Warlock to put it back in his chest. Once he had done so, however, she incorrectly believed that he is healed and is now capable of true love, while the smell of her hair as well as the beauty of her skin pierced his newly awakened heart. The maiden is then brutally murdered at the hands of the Warlock, in a failed attempt to exchange his hairy heart for hers.<sup id="cite_ref-TBB_1-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TBB-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>The Warlock was a proud, arrogant, and cold young man who decided that falling in love would adversely affect his comfort and security. He sees love as a humiliation, a weakness, a drain on a person's emotional and material resources; not even the death of his parents saddened him at the very least. For fearing love, he went to the extreme to prevent himself from falling prey, by removing his heart via dark magic. Originally believing his solitary existence is something to be envied, the Warlock was offended when he was pitied and ridiculed for his inability to attract companionship despite his wealth, property and talent. He is pushed to search for "a wife superior to all others" only to salvage his pride, which was severely wounded when he overheard what his servants had to say about him. His long term separation with his heart has reduced his humanity as time went on, ultimately turning him into an unrestrained beast when he was reunited his shriveled and hairy heart.<sup id="cite_ref-TBB_1-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TBB-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

</p><p>After returning his heart into his body, he did not feel any remorse for killing the maiden on a bestial impulse, instead he was trying to take her heart as a replacement.
