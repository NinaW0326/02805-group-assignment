Despite being taken aback by Riddle's interest in such <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Magic</a>, he reluctantly agreed to give him an overview of Horcruxes, on the condition that everything they discussed remained between them. Slughorn was further horrified at the thought of multiple Horcruxes. Using the information, Riddle later went on to create six Horcruxes, making himself immortal.

<p>Having resigned from his positions at Hogwarts in <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a>, Slughorn chose to enter retirement. He had a care-free retirement, and took up residence at the home of his late parents. He enjoyed reading, visiting his old Slug Club members and inviting them to reunion feasts at his home. The only thing he missed was teaching, and the idea that new students would not know who he was.<sup id="cite_ref-shortstories_11-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shortstories-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>However, in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>, word reached Slughorn that Voldemort was still alive in a disembodied form. The guilt he had let go of returned when he realised it confirmed his original thoughts that Voldemort may have created Horcruxes.

</p><p>Slughorn went into a secluded lifestyle, moving from one Muggle house to the next, using his many and varied contacts to maintain a very comfortable lifestyle.

<p>Slughorn was described as being an enormously fat, bald, old man. He was short with an immense belly, so large that the buttons on his waistcoat usually threatened to burst off. His round stomach was usually said to precede him when he entered rooms, and when he stood, the top of his head barely reached <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s chin. His girth was seen to take up most of the compartment of the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a> and occupy at least a quarter of <a href="/wiki/Honeydukes" title="Honeydukes">Honeydukes</a> Sweet Shop. He was described as having a shiny pate, prominent, gooseberry coloured eyes, and an enormous, silver, walrus-like moustache.
</p><p>In his youth, his moustache was gingery blond and his hair was thick and straw coloured. He had pudgy hands, fat thumbs, and a vast forehead, as well as highly polished buttons on his maroon velvet jacket that he wore over his lilac silk pyjamas. Slughorn had a particular liking of lavish, old-fashioned clothes: waistcoats with gold buttons during the day and luxurious velvet smoking jackets when at home. In one particular trip to <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a>, he wore an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar and clutched a large bag of crystallised pineapple. When he duelled <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, he wore an emerald-green pair of silk pyjamas. He claimed to suffer from old age, fatigue, <a href="/wiki/Rheumatism" title="Rheumatism">rheumatism</a>, and a weak chest. According to Harry, he seemed remarkably unabashed for someone whom he had just seen pretending to be an armchair.
</p><p>However, he was still sufficiently agile to turn himself into an armchair and create a scene of chaos at short notice when he was trying to avoid unwelcome visitors, and managed to live on the run from Voldemort moving from house to house every couple of weeks (including his <a href="/wiki/Piano" title="Piano">grand piano</a>). He had a liking for embroidered clothing, with gold coloured buttons and plenty of velvet.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_18-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> His comforts included soft chairs and footstools, fine wines and books, boxes of confectionery and plump cushions, all of which cluttered the room he met Harry in. His largeness fit his personality: he was jolly and genial, bustling around, twiddling the ends of his walrus moustache and puffing out his massive belly. He at times wore a <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn%27s_pocket_watch" title="Horace Slughorn&#39;s pocket watch">silver pocket watch</a>.

<p>Horace Slughorn was described as having a bumbling, jovial sort of personality. He was rather vain and quite fond of food, especially crystallised <a href="/wiki/Pineapple" title="Pineapple">pineapple</a>. Despite being a relatively good-natured person, he only had eyes for people who he thought had talent, would go far in life, and thus give him helpful connections and be able to influence or gain benefits from them. Thus, while he invited other students to his "<a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a>", he had a tendency to rudely ignore people like <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ronald Weasley</a> because he didn't view them as important, talented, or famous enough to warrant his attention. He also turned to ignoring <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Belby" title="Marcus Belby">Marcus Belby</a> after discovering he did not have any attachment to his <a href="/wiki/Damocles_Belby" title="Damocles Belby">accomplished uncle</a>, despite inviting him to the Slug Club's reopening.

<p>Slughorn was also a bit of a hypocrite, as he told Harry he believed teachers should not have favourites but then proceeded to say that Harry's mother, <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily Evans</a>, was one of his. Shortly after this encounter, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> told Harry that in fact, while Slughorn was a teacher, he formed a group of his favourite students with him at the centre in order to forge connections, make introductions, and always reap some sort of benefit from them. In addition, he stated that he was not prejudiced against <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> students, but seemed surprised that Harry said <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> was the best in his year; despite this, he asserted that Lily was one of the most talented students he ever taught, and frequently compared Harry's talent to hers in very favourable terms. It seemed Slughorn felt that <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-blood</a> students usually displayed the best talent but was happy to bring Muggle-borns or <a href="/wiki/Half-blood" title="Half-blood">half-bloods</a> into his inner circle if he thought they were talented or gifted enough.
</p><p>Compared to Snape, Slughorn's teaching methods were more friendly, excitable, and interactive, not unlike how a good-natured laboratory professor conducts lessons. He also appeared to know how to motivate students for his subject; in his first <a href="/wiki/Potions_(class)" title="Potions (class)">Potions</a> lesson since coming out of retirement, he encouraged his students to concoct for him the <a href="/wiki/Draught_of_Living_Death" title="Draught of Living Death">Draught of Living Death</a> with a ready bottle of <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a> as reward to the student who brewed the best potion. He also exhibited no qualms at using his school connections to procure useful assets for his own benefit, as seen when he convinced <a href="/wiki/Pomona_Sprout" title="Pomona Sprout">Pomona Sprout</a> to provide him with plant samples as potion ingredients fresh from the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> Greenhouses, or when he took advantage of Hagrid's attendant despair to retrieve some of <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Acromantula_venom" title="Acromantula venom">prized venom</a>, along with the stocks of <a href="/wiki/Unicorn_hair" title="Unicorn hair">unicorn hair</a> <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> had inside his cabin. Slughorn's professional relationships with his fellow professors often worked to mutual benefit, often working with his fellow instructors to maximise their benefit to the students, such as ensuring that his students had plenty of spare ingredients from Pomona Sprout's greenhouses while offering his own expertise within her field in exchange for the favour.

<p>Slughorn generally displayed the more positive traits of <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>, such as ambition. He never wished to be famous himself; instead, he preferred to help others become famous, which, if successful, gained him influence and/or benefits from them, such as being able to recommend the next junior member of the <a href="/wiki/Goblin_Liaison_Office" title="Goblin Liaison Office">Goblin Liaison Office</a>, free <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> tickets or a box of his favourite crystallised pineapple. By his own admittance, he revered magical <a href="/wiki/Creature" title="Creature">creatures</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantulas</a>, and thought <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a> was a magnificent specimen.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_18-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Slughorn had evident self-centredness; he mentioned that all the mead he brought was quite safe as he had a <a href="/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf">house-elf</a> drink some from each bottle to ensure it was not <a href="/wiki/Poison" title="Poison">poisoned</a>. This revelation disquieted Harry, as it showed that Slughorn saw nothing wrong with risking a house-elf's life to protect his own. Although, there is the very strong possibility Slughorn possessed an <a href="/wiki/Antidote" title="Antidote">antidote</a> to give the house-elf if poison was present in the drink. The aforementioned possibility is extremely likely due to Slughorn's knowledge of antidotes and generally kind and caring nature, and due to his general determination not to repeat dangerous past mistakes.
</p><p>Slughorn was keen to make evermore connections, and in his post as teacher, made a habit of having regular meetings with students who were either famous, related to famous people, or talented in one way or another. Known as the "<a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a>", this group of students were constantly being invited to Slughorn's office for dinner and parties. Students that he did not consider to be "high-fliers", such as <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>, and later his son <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, were simply ignored.

<p>Slughorn's personality, in many ways, contradicted the "evil Slytherin" stereotype held by many students of the other Houses, <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindors</a> in particular. He was a good person, and did not seem to hold any real prejudice against Muggle-born witches and wizards. While he thought pure-bloods generally had more wizarding talent, he was always happy to meet and teach Muggle-borns and half-bloods who displayed great potential. He was, however, self-serving enough to favour students of status or talent, largely for the purpose of benefiting from his connection to them in the future. He was horribly guilt-ridden about the information he gave to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> about <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, and crudely edited his memory of the event to prevent anyone finding out what he had done, as much as to relieve his own guilty feelings. Though <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> would undoubtedly have tried in earnest to convey the importance of the contents of the original memory, Slughorn stubbornly refused to give it up till <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>. He was also horrified at his accidental poisoning of Ron Weasley and later came to visit him in the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Wing" title="Hospital Wing">Hospital Wing</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_18-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Despite his ambition, Slughorn knew where to draw his personal boundaries. His tendency to ally himself with powerful, talented, and important people never blinded him to his moral values, and thus, he was never tempted to join forces with Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> and others who were keen to surround themselves with powerful people, he was not one to side with whoever was winning. Slughorn knew where his loyalties lay, and he fought against <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> head on during the final battle.
</p><p>Although Slughorn initially attempted to hide and avoid getting himself into any danger or conflict, he was willing to defend himself and other people when his loyalties were questioned, when backed to a corner and when it was necessary to defend those he cared about. This was especially shown during the final battle as while it initially seemed that Slughorn fled in cowardice with the other <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherins</a>, he had actually only left to round up reinforcements and returned to the battle. This, along with the fact that he fearlessly stood up to Voldemort himself, showed that he was a courageous man. He was also strong willed and was able to master <a href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a>, a rare ability that requires a strong mind.
</p><p>Slughorn possessed a great ability to feel shame and regret for his mistakes, many of which he often tried to cover up, hide from, or when it came down to it, fight with all of his magical power. His determination not repeat past mistakes or to lay them to rest was rather evident in his handing of the Horcrux memory to Harry and his duel with Voldemort. He clearly regarded his giving of information about the possibility of multiple Horcruxes to young Tom Riddle to be his greatest mistake.
</p><p>Slughorn was also a rather analytical and calculating individual, able to see great potential in students, but also had his blind spots as well, such his overlooking of Ron Weasley's latent talents and being vulnerable to Tom Riddle's flattery. His analytical abilities and mindset allowed him to deduce Harry's early attempts to coax the Horcrux memory from him. In many ways, not only did Slughorn possess an inordinately strong moral compass, but was also the consummate strategist, such as when he fetched necessary reinforcements from Hogsmeade to aid in the Battle of Hogwarts. This propensity towards strategy and making powerful alliances is compliant with the Slytherin traits of cunning and fraternity, as Slytherins will take calculated risks and always have a backup plan, usually relying on staunch and stalwart allies, something that Slughorn was a certifiable genius at. In a great many ways, Horace Slughorn embodied the best traits that Slytherin House has to offer: camaraderie, strong social intuition, cunning, and strategy.

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a></b>: Slughorn possessed superb defensive abilities against Dark Magic and his knowledge of the Dark Arts also gave him knowledge of many advanced defensive spells.

This was evident when teaching <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potions</a>, as he was able to distinguish between the obsessive love caused by love potions and the genuine, unconditional love felt by most people. He was clearly capable of love, as it allowed him to overcome his shame of his <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a> memory and to give it to <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry</a> as a weapon to destroy the monster he felt partially responsible for creating, as it was <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> who killed so many of his beloved students, especially <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J.

Slughorn also felt great need to protect his students, regardless of favouritism, as was his most redeeming quality. It was also his ability to love which gave Slughorn the strength to ultimately show his true loyalties and fight against Voldemort himself head-on.</li>
<li><b>Social networking</b>: Slughorn was a seasoned and gifted individual in his ability form powerful and lasting connections throughout his career as a teacher. His ability to form connections for himself and others made him a valuable ally to have and was able to capitalise on this skill of his for decades for both self-serving and selfless reasons. He was also a master rally man, as he was easily able to stir the citizens of <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> into a war frenzy and gain their support to add their power to <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> against <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>.</li>

<p>Lily also gave Slughorn a bowl with some water, and a petal from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphaeaceae" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Nymphaeaceae">lily</a> that transformed into a fish, which he named <a href="/wiki/Francis" title="Francis">Francis</a>.

Slughorn was very close to Lily, whom he found to be an extremely caring and love-driven young woman, a trait that resonated with Slughorn long after her death. In a way, he felt responsible for her death along with many others for giving Tom Riddle the knowledge of Horcruxes he sought out in his schoolboy days. His desire to see her murderer stopped was enough to overcome his shame, which allowed Harry to obtain the horcrux memory and eventually avenge his mother and Slughorn's beloved student.

<p>Horace Slughorn first met Harry Potter in 1996, when Harry and Albus Dumbledore tracked him down at the <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> home he was borrowing at the time, to persuade him to return and teach at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. Given Slughorn's tendency to "collect" famous, well-connected, or talented young minds, Slughorn gave in to Dumbledore's request upon meeting Harry. He became <a href="/wiki/Potions_Master" title="Potions Master">Potions Master</a> for the <a href="/wiki/1996%E2%80%931997_school_year" title="1996–1997 school year">1996–1997 school year</a>, and wasted no time in inviting Harry to join his '<a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a>'. With the help of the <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape%27s_copy_of_Advanced_Potion-Making" title="Severus Snape&#39;s copy of Advanced Potion-Making">Half-Blood Prince's Potions textbook</a>, Harry appeared to be following in his mother's footsteps as a great potioneer, which further earned Slughorn's favour.
</p><p>During one of their <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_Albus_Dumbledore%27s_private_lessons" title="Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore&#39;s private lessons">private lessons</a>, Dumbledore showed Harry a <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">memory</a> of Slughorn's, in which a young <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> asked the Potions master about <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>. However, as the memory was obviously and unconvincingly edited to make it seem as if Slughorn had refused to answer, it was impossible to discern exactly what it was Riddle had wanted to know about Horcruxes. Dumbledore told Harry that the original memory would undoubtedly be essential in determining what ultimately defeating Voldemort would entail, and assigned Harry with the task of retrieving it.
</p><p>Slughorn sensed that Harry wanted to retrieve the memory, and subsequently tried to avoid him. He stopped Slug Club dinners, and would flee at the end of <a href="/wiki/Potion" title="Potion">Potions</a>. He felt very guilty for giving Tom Riddle information on Horcruxes.

</div>
<p>After several failed attempts, Harry eventually finessed the memory from a very drunk Slughorn, with the help of <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a> and the opportunity for Slughorn to collect a few vials of valuable <a href="/wiki/Acromantula_venom" title="Acromantula venom">Acromantula venom</a>. The 'sluggish' memory is Slughorn's memory of what he said to the young Tom Riddle, which he himself tried to blot out. The word 'sluggish' suggests that the memory is slow, lethargic, and difficult to arouse. The memory allowed for Dumbledore to confirm his suspicions that Voldemort had been planning to create seven Horcruxes, and for Harry to continue Dumbledore's mission of destroying them.
</p><p>Although Harry initially seemed Slughorn's "<i>crowning jewel</i>" as Dumbledore put it, Slughorn felt genuine care for the boy and fearlessly battled the Dark Lord head on in a gallant attempt to avenge Harry's presumed death and end the evil warmonger forever. Suffice it to say, Harry was among the many students that Slughorn came to be fond of beyond just the parameters of social climbing.

<p>Professor Slughorn was the <a href="/wiki/Potions_Master" title="Potions Master">Potions Master</a> during Tom Riddle's years at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. As Head of Tom's <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">House</a>, and given his tendency to favour students who displayed talent of some sort, Slughorn became Riddle's mentor, and was likely the professor Tom liked most. Riddle became a favourite of Slughorn's which Tom knew, and so he often manipulated Slughorn by flattering him.<sup id="cite_ref-shortstories_11-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shortstories-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> 
</p><p>One day, Riddle asked Slughorn about <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, and Slughorn, — after convincing himself Tom's intentions were "purely academic" —, reluctantly told him what it basically took to create one, though he refused to give Tom any details. Most significantly, when Tom asked if it were possible to create more than one Horcrux, Slughorn seemed appalled by the idea of it, but did not deny that it could be done in theory. Riddle did keep his promise to Slughorn about never disclosing the contents of their discussion that night, thus never implicating Slughorn's contribution to what would become Lord Voldemort. Though this was undoubtedly because Voldemort would never admit to needing help to achieve immortality and to keep his ultimate secret just that.    
</p><p>Regardless, Slughorn still had faith in Tom and ignored <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> when he tried to warn him that Tom was only using him.<sup id="cite_ref-shortstories_11-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shortstories-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Slughorn believed he had judged Tom right and defended him. However, this changed when Tom left Hogwarts. Tom disappeared having refused many great offers of employment. He severed ties with Slughorn, which upset him most possibly because he loved to keep in touch with his old students that he had considered talented in the hope of being given things in return.<sup id="cite_ref-shortstories_11-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shortstories-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>With the information from Slughorn in hand, Riddle managed to create <a href="/wiki/Seven" title="Seven">seven</a> Horcruxes and achieve something near <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">immortality</a>. When Riddle had returned to Hogwarts many years later to seek employment at Hogwarts, Slughorn was terrified and hid away in his office so that he didn't have to talk to him.<sup id="cite_ref-shortstories_11-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shortstories-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When Tom reappeared as Voldemort and rumours began during the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a> that Voldemort had indeed achieved immortality, Slughorn felt incredibly guilty about telling Tom how to achieve it. He was so ashamed, he even modified his own memory so he did not have to remember. He stayed at Hogwarts until the end of the war, believing it was the safest place to be. When Voldemort apparently died in 1981, he was pleased. The guilt still continued in a smaller way though, as he was scared that someone would still find out what he said and it was what made him retire from Hogwarts shortly after the war ended.<sup id="cite_ref-shortstories_11-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shortstories-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When Voldemort returned in 1995, Slughorn knew without a doubt that Tom had created Horcruxes. He was scared that Voldemort may seek him out, to either recruit him or kill him to keep their secret safe. Voldemort did soon try to find Slughorn, which he did not understand at the time. Slughorn escaped and hid from Voldemort for over a year, and even returned to Hogwarts.<sup id="cite_ref-shortstories_11-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shortstories-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>

As Slughorn was equally disinclined to join the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, Dumbledore most likely accepted Slughorn for the fairly self-serving, but overall harmless and genuinely talented Wizard he was. Dumbledore asked Slughorn to resume his old position in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, and Slughorn accepted after being enticed with the prospect of being able to teach Harry Potter.
</p><p>Dumbledore wanted to tread carefully with Slughorn and not force him to divulge the memory because it would ruin their friendship. Dumbledore feared that if Slughorn felt betrayed, he may even leave the school and join the Dark Lord.
</p><p>Dumbledore suspected that Slughorn may have inadvertently given <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> some dangerous information; in order to determine exactly what Riddle had been planning to use it for, Dumbledore attempted to retrieve the memory of the specific discussion from Slughorn. Ashamed of what he'd allowed himself to be charmed into doing, Slughorn modified his own memory and gave Dumbledore that version. Given Slughorn's fondness for famous and/or talented students, Dumbledore tasked <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, arguably the most famous student Slughorn would ever teach, to retrieve the original memory. As Dumbledore had predicted, Harry had been in the perfect position to convince Slughorn to allow the truth to be uncovered, and together, Harry and Dumbledore set about the task of destroying Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>.
</p><p>Horace was highly shocked by Dumbledore's death and attended his funeral. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Horace fought the Dark Lord head on in honour of his friend's death and to protect his former students and school.

<p>Horace Slughorn had a good relationship with most members of the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> staff. In addition to having been an old friend and long-time colleague of Headmaster <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, Slughorn was quite friendly with the other members of the Hogwarts staff.
</p><p>He was quite familiar with <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, the former <a href="/wiki/Potions_Master" title="Potions Master">Potions Master</a>, and one of his former students. Slughorn possibly considered Snape to be a very intelligent and talented student, and invited him to join his <a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a>. They appeared to have a good relationship even during their later years as professors, until the <a href="/wiki/1997-1998_school_year" class="mw-redirect" title="1997-1998 school year">1997-1998 school year</a>, after Snape apparently murdered <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> and usurped his position as Headmaster of Hogwarts. However, Slughorn later learned that Snape was, in fact, a loyal member of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>.
</p><p>He was also a friend of <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_(class)" title="Transfiguration (class)">Transfiguration</a> professor; though the two were heads of rival Houses, that was not a factor likely to affect their relationship, as, like Minerva, Slughorn did not give preferential treatment to the students of his own House. However, the fact that he did give preferential treatment to students based on other things may not have sat terribly well the Transfiguration professor. However, in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Minerva told Slughorn that, if he and his students wanted to join <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, she would fight against them.

<ul><li>'Horace' was the name of an epicurean Roman poet, fond of food and someone who liked to make friends with people of influence.</li>
<li>'Eugene' is comes from the Greek εὐγενής (eugenēs), "noble", εὖ (eu), "well" and γένος (genos), "race, stock, kin". As such, the name means literally "well-born".</li>
<li>'Flaccus' was a cognomen of the ancient Roman plebeian family Fulvius, considered one of the most illustrious gentes of the city. As usual for cognomina, "Flaccus" was likely originally a nickname, probably of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus, the founder of the family. It has been variously interpreted as meaning "big ears", "flop ears", "floppy", or "fatty".</li>
<li>Slughorn  - a 'slug' refers to the garden slug, a cousin to the snail but without the shell. Additionally, 'Slughorn' is a historical heraldic term meaning 'war-cry', derived from an old Scottish word and later becoming the modern 'slogan', but may also be derived from his large, sluggish physique.</li></ul>

<dd></dd></dl></div>
<ul><li>Horace is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">British</a> actor <a href="/wiki/Jim_Broadbent" title="Jim Broadbent">Jim Broadbent</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)" title="Harry Potter (film series)">film adaptations</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i> (voice only) and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i>.</li>
<li>In the film, Horace is depicted in tweed outfits rather than the described velvet, and is not bald, and has no moustache.
<ul><li>Also, the Slughorn depicted in the film is more interested in collecting precious materials such as <a href="/wiki/Venomous_Tentacula" title="Venomous Tentacula">Tentacula</a> leaves and <a href="/wiki/Acromantula_venom" title="Acromantula venom">Acromantula venom</a> or in getting together talented students, rather than in teaching. On the other hand, Slughorn in the books still loves teaching and takes his job very seriously.</li></ul></li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> mentions to Harry that he "never had a lot to do" with Slughorn, implying the two had never had any interaction with each other. However, seeing as Tom Riddle went to school with Hagrid, it follows to the conclusion that Horace taught Hagrid. As there are teachers and students that never really relate in all walks of life, Hagrid might well have simply been saying that Horace had never had any <i>direct </i>interaction during his time at school.</li>
<li>Slughorn's exact age is never specified, although it is known that he was old enough to teach <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> (who started Hogwarts in 1938) and younger than <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> (who was born in 1881). If we assume a Potions Master must have finished school at Hogwarts before becoming a teacher, this means Slughorn was born no later than <a href="/wiki/1920" title="1920">1920</a> -- and, in all likelihood, earlier than that, since 17-year-old teachers do not seem to come by very often -- and no earlier than <a href="/wiki/1881" class="mw-redirect" title="1881">1881</a>. This means that, at the moment he first met Harry Potter in <a href="/wiki/Budleigh_Babberton" title="Budleigh Babberton">Budleigh Babberton</a> (mid-July 1996), Slughorn was between 76 and 115 years old, and that at the moment of his permanent retirement he was between 96 and 135 years old. This potentially makes him the second oldest known Hogwarts teacher, only <a href="/wiki/Cuthbert_Binns" title="Cuthbert Binns">Professor Binns</a> being, supposedly, older than him.</li>
<li>Although in the novel of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Horace mentions that he taught Snape, in real life Jim Broadbent (born May 1949) who plays Horace is three years younger than Alan Rickman (born February 1946) who plays Snape.</li>
<li>Horace's direct duel with Voldemort, alongside <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a> is omitted from the film. Instead he takes a swig of something stashed under his cloak, then begins casting protective charms such as <a href="/wiki/Protego_Maxima" title="Protego Maxima">Protego Maxima</a>. He is later seen tending to <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch">Argus Filch</a>'s wounds, and regaling his triumphs in the battle with <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Filius Flitwick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Pomona_Sprout" title="Pomona Sprout">Pomona Sprout</a>.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>, Harry comes across Horace getting some herbs with the help of <a href="/wiki/Pomona_Sprout" title="Pomona Sprout">Pomona Sprout</a>; in the film, Harry finds him stealing <a href="/wiki/Venomous_Tentacula_leaf" title="Venomous Tentacula leaf">tentacula leaves</a> without her knowledge with the intent of selling them.</li>
<li>One of the names Slughorn calls <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> is Rupert. As J.K.
