<dl><dd><span title="Source:&#160;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">"<i>Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta­minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were­wolves to overcome the wizards.

<p><b>Fenrir Greyback</b> (fl. <a href="/wiki/1945" title="1945">1945</a> – <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> notorious for his savagery and preference for attacking children. He was a leader in his community and strived to infect as many people as possible with <a href="/wiki/Lycanthropy" title="Lycanthropy">lycanthropy</a>, hoping to build an army strong enough to eventually take over the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding community</a>. It was he who infected <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> with <a href="/wiki/Lycanthropy" title="Lycanthropy">lycanthropy</a> when Remus's father (<a href="/wiki/Lyall_Lupin" title="Lyall Lupin">Lyall Lupin</a>) insulted werewolves and said "<i>they deserve nothing less than death.</i>"
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>, Greyback and the pack of werewolves he led allied themselves with <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, though they were not considered <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> as they did not have the Dark Mark. Greyback fought in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">Battle of the Astronomy Tower</a>, during which he expressed an eagerness to bite the children of <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> and left <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a> badly scarred,<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and later that year led a gang of <a href="/wiki/Snatchers" title="Snatchers">Snatchers</a> when Voldemort was in control of the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Greyback fought in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, where he at one point attacked  <a href="/wiki/Lavender_Brown" title="Lavender Brown">Lavender Brown</a>, but was incapacitated by Hermione and then a crystal ball to the head by <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney" title="Sybill Trelawney">Professor Trelawney</a>.

<p>By the mid-1960s, the amount of Dark magical activity across the country was growing steadily. While few knew what was behind it all, this was a precursor to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>'s first rise to power. The <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> were recruiting Dark creatures to help them overthrow the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-PM_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and among them was Fenrir Greyback, who did not join the Death Eaters because he believed in Voldemort's cause, but because allying himself with them would give him greater access to potential victims.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_2-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Although considered to be a Death Eater by the enemies of the Dark Lord, Greyback was not given the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> on his forearm.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Nor was he ever accepted as a Death Eater by those belonging to Voldemort's innermost circle of followers, as Voldemort was prejudiced against his <a href="/wiki/Lycanthropy" title="Lycanthropy">lycanthropy</a>; despite Greyback‘s services to their cause: Greyback was used as a weapon by Voldemort, who would often use the notorious werewolf to intimidate people to do his bidding, threatening to send Greyback after their children.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
It was  around 1965, after one such attack that resulted in the deaths of two <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> children, that Greyback was brought in for questioning before the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>. Due to the inadequacy and ill-maintenance of the <a href="/wiki/Werewolf_Registry" title="Werewolf Registry">Werewolf Registry</a>, the Ministry did not know Greyback to be a werewolf, and he pretended to be a Muggle tramp who was amazed at finding himself in a room full of wizards and horrified at the talk about the dead children.<sup id="cite_ref-PM_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>His filthy clothing and lack of wand managed to convince most of the questioning committee, although <a href="/wiki/Lyall_Lupin" title="Lyall Lupin">Lyall Lupin</a>, an authority on Non-Human Spiritous Apparitions that was among them, recognised certain telltale signs in Greyback's appearance that made him suggest that Greyback should be kept in detention until the next full moon, which was, coincidentally, one day away. The ignorant and foolish committee members thought it unnecessary, and Greyback started taunting Lupin, who grew angry and described werewolves as "<i>soulless, evil, deserving of nothing but death</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-PM_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

As the little boy slept peacefully in his bed, Greyback forced open his window and bit him.

The deed, however, was done, and Remus Lupin became a full-fledged werewolf from that point on.<sup id="cite_ref-PM_1-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

During the confrontation, Cecil tried to use the <a href="/wiki/Homorphus_Charm" title="Homorphus Charm">Homorphus Charm</a> on Greyback's werewolf companions, but, as he was out of range, it failed.

<p>Unlike most werewolves, Greyback took both pleasure in and advantage of his abilities and savagery when transformed, and stationed himself near his targets. He enjoyed attacking them and specialised in biting children, hoping to infect them and raise them to hate humanity, though sometimes killing them when going overboard. Despite his ideology of thinking werewolves deserve blood, and his attempt to recruit more werewolves for his cause, Greyback would ultimately seem to be just a primal savage who enjoyed killing. Greyback's savagery was what differed him from most other werewolves: while most of them bit and infected unintentionally during only their transformed state, Greyback actually went as far as eat and kill purposely whether in his human or werewolf form. Greyback was feared more than most werewolves due to his brutality, even Dumbledore was shocked that Draco Malfoy allowed Greyback to enter Hogwarts, and was slightly disgusted after learning about Greyback's cannibalism.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_2-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Being a werewolf and therefore not subscribing to the Death Eaters' views on racial superiority, Greyback was not branded with the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a>, despite being invited into the ranks of the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> and permitted to wear their robes.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_3-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> This may have been because Lord Voldemort was prejudiced against Werewolves as well as Muggles and Muggle-borns. Therefore he would not allow Greyback to become an actual Death Eater, yet he was too valuable of an accomplice not to have in his ranks. Greyback showed clear resentment at the lack of respect he received but sided with the Death Eaters because of the amount of victims he would have access to. Most Death Eaters seemed to regard him with disgust, with Yaxley throwing a <a href="/wiki/Curse" title="Curse">curse</a> at him in the Astronomy Tower for attacking without permission and Bellatrix Lestrange forcing him to his knees before her in Malfoy Manor. The revulsion that the other Death Eaters felt towards Greyback was likely because of his lycanthropy as well as his implied sexual perversions. Despite his resentment and mistreatment, he usually only mildly protested about the Death Eater's behaviour towards him, possibly out of fear for their power and what they would do to him if he stopped cooperating with them. Indeed, it is very likely that if Voldemort had won the Second Wizarding War, he would have tossed Fenrir aside once he was no longer useful, because Voldemort detested werewolves.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_3-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Fenrir has also proven he had a low tolerance for insults and holds grudges, as he took vengeance on <a href="/wiki/Lyall_Lupin" title="Lyall Lupin">Lyall Lupin</a> for an offensive remark by attacking <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">his son</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-PM_1-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<ul><li>Greyback was portrayed by the late <a href="/wiki/Dave_Legeno" title="Dave Legeno">Dave Legeno</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>. Only a wanted poster of Greyback in the film explains what sort of creature Greyback is, and the scene in which he mauls Bill Weasley is omitted from the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>. In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, Bill tells Harry that he was attacked by Fenrir Greyback sometime before the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Seven_Potters" title="Battle of the Seven Potters">Battle of the Seven Potters</a> takes place.</li>
<li>The role was offered to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McKidd" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Kevin McKidd">Kevin McKidd</a>, but he was forced to turn it down, due to a contractual obligation to another project.<sup id="cite_ref-snitchmckidd_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-snitchmckidd-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Hisao_Egawa" title="Hisao Egawa">Hisao Egawa</a> voiced Greyback in the Japanese dubs.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Scabior" title="Scabior">Scabior</a> takes the role as leader of the Snatchers, while Greyback is seen taking orders from him.</li>
<li>In contrast to his very vicious behaviour in the books, Greyback has very little if anything to do in the films. In all three films in which he appears, he speaks twice, once in the Astronomy Tower scene in <i>Half-Blood Prince</i>, and in <i>Deathly Hallows: Part 1</i> when Harry says his name is Vernon Dudley and the Snatchers don't find the name on the list.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i>, Hermione's <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">Stunning Spell</a> sends Greyback off the <a href="/wiki/Viaduct_Courtyard" title="Viaduct Courtyard">Viaduct Courtyard</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Ravine" title="Ravine">ravine</a> below and to his death after he was discovered mauling Lavender Brown. As this contradicts the events of the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">novel</a>, it cannot be considered canon to the books (in which she does blast him away from Lavender but clearly not off a cliff, as he turns up again in the final part of the battle).</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Dave_Legeno" title="Dave Legeno">Dave Legeno</a> had many animal hairs, such as goat, affixed to him when he portrayed Greyback.</li>
<li>He was possibly a pure-blood or half-blood, as he appeared to be prejudiced against Muggle-borns and called them "Mudbloods" (not to mention it is highly unlikely that the already unpopular Greyback would have been accepted into the Death Eaters at all if he'd been a Muggle-Born as well as a werewolf).</li>
<li>Greyback is likely based on French <i>loup-garou</i> tales coming from the 15th to 17th centuries. His language and appearance bear close connections to Jean Grenier. The latter was a young boy accused of being a werewolf.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(video_game)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)"><i>Half-Blood Prince</i> video game</a>, during his attack on the Burrow, Fenrir takes Ginny hostage. When Harry arrives to save her he is seen standing over her. After the duel he is forced to retreat and sets the Burrow on fire with Bellatrix.</li>
<li>While it's unknown what happens to Fenrir after the Battle at Hogwarts, there is a slight chance that he managed to escape back to his pack (although unlikely, as Ron and Neville are described as "bringing him down" shortly before the death of Voldemort, most likely either killing or Stunning him).</li>
<li>Although werewolves are not truly affected by silver as they are in Muggle legends, Fenrir was defeated by Ron and Neville during the Battle of Hogwarts, the latter of which may have been wielding a certain <a href="/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor%27s_Sword" class="mw-redirect" title="Godric Gryffindor&#39;s Sword">sword with a silver blade</a>. However, the sword has Basilisk venom absorbed into its blade, so it is possible that if the sword had wounded or killed Greyback, it may have been because of the venom, not that the sword's blade is silver.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i> Greyback has long brushed hair but in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i> he has dreadlocks.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_5-7" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7</a></i>, when Greyback attacks Lavender, he bites her leg off. Then, Hermione throws a bone to him. When Greyback catches it in the air, Hermione defeats him with the <a href="/wiki/Reductor_Curse" title="Reductor Curse">Reductor Curse</a>, knocking him out. It is completely unknown what happened with him after this.</li>
<li>Ironically, despite being one of the most notorious werewolves to ever live, he never actually appeared in werewolf form in any of the books, films, or video games until <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter:_Hogwarts_Mystery" title="Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery">Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery</a></i>.</li>
<li>Fenrir is, in many ways, similar to Sabertooth from the <i>X-Men</i> comic book series. One of which is they're both "mindless" beasts covered in hair and with sharp claws that follow an intelligent leader who believes that humans must be eliminated because they are weak. Another similarity being their incredibly homicidal, sadistic, and psychopathic natures and how both are also torturers and sexual predators in addition. In fact, Sabertooth's design in the film <i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine </i>is strikingly similar to Fenrir Greyback's appearance in the films.</li>
<li>Greyback is also similar to Anita Lucas from the TV series <i>Once Upon a Time</i>. Both are werewolves who have given fully in to their wolf half, and have been known to willingly attack humans even before transforming. Furthermore, Anita seems to share Greyback's philosophy on werewolves' eventually rising up against humankind.</li></ul>
