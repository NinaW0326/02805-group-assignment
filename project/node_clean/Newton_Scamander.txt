Moments later <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Kowalski" title="Jacob Kowalski">Jacob Kowalski</a>, a <a href="/wiki/No-Maj" class="mw-redirect" title="No-Maj">No-Maj</a> with a case full of confectionery, bumped into him, falling over Scamander's magical suitcase. Newt helped him up, and Jacob went to the bank. The confusion around Scamander caught Mary Lou's attention. Unaware that Newt was a wizard, Mary Lou spoke directly to him, asking if he was a <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">seeker</a> of truth, to which Newt replied that he was a more of a <a href="/wiki/Chaser" title="Chaser">chaser</a>. When she asked him if he was ready to follow her and her organisation, Newt noticed that a <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Niffler</a> escaped from his suitcase, so he moved to the bank, with Tina following him out of curiosity.

<p>While searching the creature, Scamander exchanged a few sentences with Kowalski, learning about his aim to get a loan so he could start a bakery. When he noticed the Niffler robbing people and moved toward it, he unintentionally left behind an <a href="/wiki/Occamy_egg" title="Occamy egg">occamy egg</a>. Kowalski picked it up, intending to give it back to the wizard. However before he could do this, he was called to talk about a loan with <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Bingley" title="Gilbert Bingley">Gilbert Bingley</a>. While Jacob discussed his loan, Newt was still chasing the Niffler, which jumped onto the cart to the elevator. When Jacob left the office, showing Newt the cracking egg, Scamander attracted Kowalski to himself using the <a href="/wiki/Summoning_Charm" title="Summoning Charm">Summoning Charm</a>, after which he disapparated with him to the entrance of the bank's vault. Newt then put the newly-hatched <a href="/wiki/Occamy" title="Occamy">Occamy</a> into a suitcase, calming down the other animals as he did so. When Newt used the <a href="/wiki/Unlocking_Charm" title="Unlocking Charm">Unlocking Charm</a> to get to the vault in which his <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Niffler</a> had hidden, both men were discovered by Mr Bingley, who inferred that they were going to rob the bank, and activated the alarm. In response, Newt quickly immobilised him with the <a href="/wiki/Full_Body-Bind_Curse" title="Full Body-Bind Curse">Full Body-Bind Curse</a> and shook the Niffler, emptying it of the stolen money and gold. Before the armed guards entered the room, Newt disapparated himself with the shocked Jacob to the street near the bank.

<p>After throwing the Niffler into the suitcase, Newt apologised to Jacob for his antics, and took out <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander%27s_wand" title="Newton Scamander&#39;s wand">his wand</a> with the intention of <a href="/wiki/Memory_Charm" title="Memory Charm">removing his unwanted memories</a>. However, before he could do this, Kowalski knocked the wizard to the ground with his case and fled. Newt tried to follow Jacob, but Tina came round the corner at the same time and, grabbing his elbow, she disapparated them to a narrow street in front of the bank. Unnerved by what she had witnessed, Tina showed Newt her old <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> ID card, letting him think she was "some kind of investigator", and after questioning him on why he let the creature run free, and why he did not obliviate the <a href="/wiki/No-Maj" class="mw-redirect" title="No-Maj">No-Maj</a>, she grabbed Newt again and apparated with him near the <a href="/wiki/Woolworth_Building" title="Woolworth Building">Woolworth Building</a>. When they entered, the building magically transformed into the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">headquarters of MACUSA</a>. Newt told Tina that the reason for his visit to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">United States</a> was the purchase of an <a href="/wiki/Appaloosa_Puffskein" title="Appaloosa Puffskein">Appaloosa Puffskein</a>, and Tina explained in response that there was a <a href="/wiki/Ban_on_Experimental_Breeding" title="Ban on Experimental Breeding">Ban on Experimental Breeding</a> in New York and they had shut down the Appaloosa Puffskein breeder some time before. When they took the elevator to the <a href="/wiki/Major_Investigation_Department" title="Major Investigation Department">Major Investigation Department</a>, Goldstein tried to present Newt as a suspicious character in the middle of a meeting about the attack of an unidentified beast in the city, but <a href="/wiki/Seraphina_Picquery" title="Seraphina Picquery">Seraphina Picquery</a>, President of MACUSA, firmly dismissed the two. Later in the <a href="/wiki/Wand_Permit_Office" title="Wand Permit Office">Wand Permit Office</a> where Tina was working, she asked Newt whether he has permission for a wand, but he only said that he applied for it by letter. When <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a>, the Head of the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement_(MACUSA)" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement (MACUSA)">Department of Magical Law Enforcement</a>, entered the cabinet, Tina told him about the events in the bank, then opened the suitcase, which supposedly belonged to Scamander - but after seeing that it contained cakes belonging to Kowalski, it became clear that Newt had accidentally taken Jacob's case instead of his own. MACUSA no longer took them seriously, but Newt and Tina realised that in the ensuing chaos of trying catch a Niffler, Kowalski must have taken the case containing the creature. Newt immediately decided to find Kowalski.
</p><p>While looking for Kowalski, Newt and Tina saw a <a href="/wiki/Billywig" title="Billywig">Billywig</a> flying over their heads and a crowd of people in front of the destroyed building. Newt realised that Jacob had accidentally opened the suitcase and several creatures must have escaped, turning a small mix-up into an incident of major proportions (as magical and non-magical relations in the United States were already frail, due in part to the presence of a Muggle fanatical extremist group, containing the incident would require the intervention of MACUSA). When a drunken tramp said to a police officer that the reason of the disaster was not gas, but the huge <a href="/wiki/Hippopotamus" title="Hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a>-like animal, Scamander obliviated him. While the tramp joined the people insisting there had been a gas explosion, Newt ran into the damaged building. In one of the rooms, he saw the effects of his beasts: there were traces of paws, broken furniture, broken glass, a hole in the wall, an opened suitcase and Kowalski himself having been bitten by one of the creatures. Newt quickly <a href="/wiki/Mending_Charm" title="Mending Charm">repaired</a> Jacob's apartment. When Tina entered the room, Newt found a <a href="/wiki/Murtlap" title="Murtlap">Murtlap</a> and put him into the suitcase, and tried again to erase Jacob's memory. Tina did not let this happen, explaining that they now needed him as a witness, but as Jacob showed signs of injury, Tina grabbed both men and disapparated, unaware that a Niffler was still there.

<p>However, after leaving the Goldsteins' apartment, Newt spotted his Niffler behind a window of the jewellery store. He used the <a href="/wiki/Finestra_spell" title="Finestra spell">Finestra</a> spell to shatter the glass and get inside. Newt furiously attempted to capture the Niffler, falling through the other window in the process. Subsequently, they were confronted by a squad of policemen, who were puzzled by the sight of the Niffler. Jacob then directed their attention to a lion wandering right by them, giving him and Newt the opportunity to disapparate from the street.

<p>Following the feather, the two ended up in a café. There, the French wizard introduced himself to both men as <a href="/wiki/Yusuf_Kama" title="Yusuf Kama">Yusuf Kama</a>. Newt questioned him about Tina, so Yusuf took them to his <a href="/wiki/Yusuf_Kama%27s_hideout" title="Yusuf Kama&#39;s hideout">hideout</a> in one of the Parisian sewers, where he had in fact imprisoned Tina. Kama did the same with Newt and Jacob and said to Newt that he will not release them until he hunts down Credence Barebone. However, Kama then unexpectedly fainted, so Newt released Pickett to unlock the lock in the gate freeing himself, Tina, and Jacob. They then approached the unconscious Yusuf Kama and heard a powerful roar coming from above.

He chased them, but Tina stunned him and tied him up to a chair - to Newt's joy, who said that might have been the best moment of his life.

Grindelwald sent his followers away to spread the word and he began the fight, <a href="/wiki/Protego_Diabolica" title="Protego Diabolica">creating a circle of black flame</a> to divide followers from enemies. Newt and <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a> unsuccessfully tried to pull Credence away from flames, same as Jacob want to do with Queenie, which was also at the rally. When they crossed unharmed and disapparated, Grindelwald then commanded his flames to kill Newt and Theseus, asking Newt did he think that Dumbledore will mourn after him, who both only managed to hold them back with the <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">Shield Charm</a>. Leta in response attacked Grindelwald and blasted his <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_skull-hookah" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s skull-hookah">skull-hookah</a> into pieces, sacrificing herself in an effort to give Newt, Theseus and the others time to get away. Before being killed by the dark wizard's flames she said to Newt and Theseus that she loved one of them, leaving Scamander brothers devastated. Newt seized Theseus and apparated with him outside the mausoleum, same as Tina did with Jacob and Yusuf with Nagini.

<p>Despite managing to reconcile with Tina, Newt was powerless to stop Grindelwald from delivering a rousing speech, sharing a vision, threatening Paris with cursed fire and collecting Queenie, Credence and his followers to strike against <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> (thus ridding himself of Albus Dumbledore) and the whole Wizarding and Muggle Worlds. During the battle that took place between Newt and Grindelwald, Scamander tragically lost his beloved Leta Lestrange, which finally compelled him to openly join the fight against the most dangerous dark wizard of his age.
</p><p>After the events in the mausoleum, Newt, along with group from Paris, picked up Travers and Spielman and travelled to Hogwarts to meet with Dumbledore. Newt delivered him the pendant, so Dumbledore could destroy it, henceforth allowing himself to finally participate in the war and defeat Grindelwald.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_31-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>

<p>When communicating with other people, Newt was often an extremely awkward man, uncompromising and eccentric in the opinions of his peers. He preferred the company of his magical beasts, whom he expressed terror at the thought of them coming to harm. Unlike his confident older brother who was respected by his superiors, those in the Ministry (except for his brother and Leta Lestrange) didn't hold him in that high a regard. Newt was also uncomfortable with affection between himself and another human, struggling to come up with an explanation for Tina about his "engagement" to Leta, and disliking being hugged by his older brother.
</p><p>That being said, Newt was a deeply compassionate man, speaking reasonably with Credence Barebone despite him being in a volatile and dangerous Obscurus form, and embracing Theseus after a battle with Grindelwald lost them Leta Lestrange, even though Newt was uncomfortable doing so in the past. It must be noted that despite clearly being bitter towards Theseus and Leta's engagement, Newt was still willing to not only act cordial, but even be the best man at the wedding, although he clearly showed his bitterness by refusing to interact with them both at once by declining any offers to see them. He even defended Leta when she showed her self-hatred for her part in <a href="/wiki/Corvus_Lestrange_(V)" title="Corvus Lestrange (V)">Corvus V's</a> death, when she lamented that Newt "had never met a monster he couldn't love". This shows that Newt's capacity for empathy outweighs his social difficulties. Furthermore, Newt developed a strong and consistent friendship with the No-Maj Jacob Kowalski, whom he admitted to really like and to really appreciate for his qualities and his helpfulness during their adventures, and to whom he even went out of his way to anonymously give <a href="/wiki/Occamy_egg" title="Occamy egg">Occamy eggs</a> so that Jacob could open his own bakery. This cements Newt's lack of typical prejudice against Muggles that was common amongst most wizards when he first went to New York.
</p><p>A man of principle, Newt was not the sort of man to discriminate against people based on their heritage or beliefs. He was also seen to be courteous with non-magical individuals like <a href="/wiki/Mary_Lou_Barebone" title="Mary Lou Barebone">Mary Lou Barebone</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Kowalski" title="Jacob Kowalski">Jacob Kowalski</a>, the latter of which with whom he formed a close friendship. He expressed disgust at the idea of being one of Gellert Grindelwald's fanatics, going as far as to angrily told off the Dark Wizard, who was disguised as Percival Graves, and questioning him for even suggesting it, and did not remotely believe in wizard supremacy. He was also morally astute, expressing shock and discontent at morbidness and cruelty, such as the idea of using the <a href="/wiki/Obscurus" title="Obscurus">Obscurus</a> that killed a child for personal gain. Despite this Newt himself admitted that he showed poor judgement in his youth; he was also outspoken in his opinion of Aurors, despite Tina Goldstein herself being an Auror. Another example is when he brought his Thunderbird to the United States to set him free, let alone an entire suitcase full of magical creatures, given MACUSA's curse-to-kill policy at the time on such creatures.<sup id="cite_ref-FB2017_36-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FB2017-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Another possible explanation of his behaviour is that it came from <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> himself, who was a staunch believer in the theory that Newt was actually acutely aware of the price of his actions, yet morally bound to always do the right thing, without any regard for safety, personal gain or even his own well being, with Dumbledore going as far as claiming that he admired Newt for not seeking power for himself. Dumbledore respected and admired Newt enough to speak out fervently against his expulsion from Hogwarts.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_31-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> Indeed, Newt showed that he cared more for what was right than what would benefit himself, as he was not swayed by Gellert Grindelwald on either of their encounters, and strove to defeat the Dark wizard at all costs.

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">Magical</a> mastery</b>: Newt, despite his awkward behaviour and initial lack of recognition, proved himself to wield considerable magical power and skill that made him worthy of being deemed the favourite student of Albus Dumbledore. In addition to his ability to face and tame some of the most dangerous beasts in the world, Newt also proved himself quite capable of magically fighting other wizards and witches, as displayed by his ability to survive the <a href="/wiki/Global_Wizarding_War" class="mw-redirect" title="Global Wizarding War">Global Wizarding War</a> as one of the main wizards who hunted down Gellert Grindelwald. He was even capable of surviving at least two encounters with <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a>, once managing to hold him at bay just enough for Credence to save him and also being the only reason why he was captured when he was fighting an entire squad of aurors and easily winning in said encounter and later aiding his brother, future wife, and Leta in holding up against the Dark Wizard, at which point he also effectively aided Theseus, Tina, Yusuf and Nicolas Flamel in saving Paris. His magical abilities were even sufficient to be begrudgingly acknowledged by the abrasive Torquil Travers as well as also Rudolph Spielman and Arnold Guzman, being even the first candidate to the mission of hunting down the extremely powerful <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a> and offered the position of an Auror, which further proved his superior magical ability, made even more impressive by how he was not even a fully-educated wizard.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a></b>: Newt was interested in <a href="/wiki/Magizoology" title="Magizoology">Magizoology</a> from a young age and throughout the years, he gained an outstanding knowledge of a wide variety of magical <a href="/wiki/Creature" title="Creature">creatures</a> from all over the world, which was what allowed him to advance within the ranks of the <a href="/wiki/Department_for_the_Regulation_and_Control_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures">Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures</a> at a meteoric rate, becoming a member of the Beast Division within mere two years of being inside the <a href="/wiki/Office_for_House-Elf_Relocation" title="Office for House-Elf Relocation">Office for House-Elf Relocation</a> and quickly achieving a series of prestigious promotions. As a <a href="/wiki/Magizoologist" title="Magizoologist">Magizoologist</a>, Newt contributed so much to the advancement of Magizoology that he was awarded an Order of Merlin Second Class and honoured with a Chocolate Frog Card named after him. Newt was shown to have a particular way with animals in a manner most wizards do not. He possesses an innate ability to communicate and bond with beasts of all shapes, such as <a href="/wiki/Thunderbird" title="Thunderbird">Thunderbirds</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bowtruckle" title="Bowtruckle">Bowtruckles</a> — treating the latter much like a parent would a child. This was also displayed by how he was the only one capable of reasoning with the <a href="/wiki/Ukrainian_Ironbelly" title="Ukrainian Ironbelly">Ukrainian Ironbelly</a> out of all the squad members sent to recruit the dragons. He is also capable of using beasts such as the <a href="/wiki/Swooping_Evil" title="Swooping Evil">Swooping Evil</a> to aid him in combat, and can control it to a degree, despite it being a relatively dangerous beast. He displayed the ability to swiftly remove the parasite inside Yusuf Kama's eyes using tweezers whereas the latter was only able to keep it at bay using eyedrops and still became incapacitated, and he was even able to use his Niffler to easily outsmart <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a> and retrieve the blood pact vial of him and Dumbledore.</li>
<li><b>Author skills</b>: Newt was an exceptional author when it came to writing books related to magical creatures, with tireless passion, having been the one who wrote the <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i>, which contained detailed information regarding many magical creatures in existence and it was of such a high quality that Newt quickly became famous for it.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Charm" title="Charm">Charms</a></b>: Newt was highly accomplished in charm-work, able to <a href="/wiki/Summoning_Charm" title="Summoning Charm">Summon</a> an egg from across a room with a man still holding onto it, and <a href="/wiki/Mending_Charm" title="Mending Charm">repair</a> the entire upper half of <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Kowalski" title="Jacob Kowalski">Jacob Kowalski</a>'s apartment in mere seconds. Newt also used the <a href="/wiki/Revelio_Charm" title="Revelio Charm">Revelio Charm</a> to bypass <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Grindelwald</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Human_Transfiguration" title="Human Transfiguration">Human Transfiguration</a>. He also performed an expansive <a href="/wiki/Extension_Charm" title="Extension Charm">Undetectable Extension Charm</a> on the interior of his suitcase, creating enough space to hold many magical creatures in replicas of their native habitats. Newt was capable of performing the advanced <a href="/wiki/Memory_Charm" title="Memory Charm">Memory Charm</a> to alter the memories of Muggles who witnessed magic, which he used to erase the <a href="/wiki/Memory" title="Memory">memory</a> of an <a href="/wiki/Unidentified_hobo" title="Unidentified hobo">Unidentified hobo</a> in 1926. Newt was also highly proficient in the <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">Shield Charm</a>, to the point that his mastery of it could thwart spells cast by even Gellert Grindelwald himself, as shown by how he fended off Grindelwald's fierce lightning attacks and even later on his <a href="/wiki/Protego_Diabolica" title="Protego Diabolica">dark blue fire</a> both by himself and alongside Theseus, and his proficiency with the <a href="/wiki/General_Counter-Spell" title="General Counter-Spell">General Counter-Spell</a> also allowed him to aid Nicolas Flamel, Tina Goldstein, Yusuf Kama and Theseus in containing said blue fire. He also displayed a command of <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_Charm" title="Atmospheric Charm">Atmospheric Charms</a>, creating weather conditions such as hot deserts and frozen snowscapes for certain creatures. Furthermore, his skill with charms allowed him to create a magical bubble capable of containing and sustaining an <a href="/wiki/Obscurus" title="Obscurus">Obscurus</a>, even after the death of its host.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> He also easily identified the powerful love enchantment cast by Queenie Goldstein on Jacob Kowalski and swiftly <a href="/wiki/Surgito" title="Surgito">removed</a> it and during his time in Paris, he displayed remarkable abilities in casting charms capable of locating individuals, successfully using a <a href="/wiki/Tracking_spell" title="Tracking spell">Tracking spell</a> to locate Tina and later performing <a href="/wiki/Avenseguim" title="Avenseguim">Avenseguim</a> to track the origins of the feather possessed by Yusuf Kama back at him. He was also able to perform simple charms, such as the <a href="/wiki/Wand-Lighting_Charm" title="Wand-Lighting Charm">Wand-Lighting Charm</a>, which he used to illuminate Yusuf Kama's infected eye so he could clearly see the water parasite inside it.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a></b>: As one would expect for being a favourite student of Albus Dumbledore back when he held the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, Newt was highly capable at defending himself against the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Forces</a>. Even Torquil Travers seemed, albeit reluctantly, to acknowledge his abilities in the field, as he was willing to allow Newt to join the Auror department. Theseus also seemed sure Newt had the ability needed to be an excellent Auror. It should be noted that Newt had not even graduated, which could be a further testament to his mastery. In addition to being capable of surviving the years he spent involved in the hunt for Gellert Grindelwald, presumably having fought and defeated many of Grindelwald's followers, he was even capable of surviving at least two subsequent duels with the arguably greatest dark wizard of all time himself. In the first duel, he was able to, even if barely, successfully repel Grindelwald's lightning curses long enough for Credence to transform. During his second altercation with the fearsome Dark Wizard, Newt alone protected himself Grindelwald's tremendously powerful <a href="/wiki/Protego_Diabolica" title="Protego Diabolica">black fire</a> while many Aurors proved to be easily killed by it, although he was not able to bypass it and prevent Credence from joining Grindelwald, and later alongside Theseus fought the Dark Wizard's devastating spell off long enough to be saved by Leta as well as successfully forcing off wild outbursts of it on his own when Grindelwald was not focusing the flames on him. He also was easily able to swiftly follow Nicolas Flamel's instructions on how to overcome said dark magic fire, by collectively casting the <a href="/wiki/General_Counter-Spell" title="General Counter-Spell">General Counter Spell</a> with his brother, Yusuf, his future wife and also Nicolas, allowing them to contain and extinguish the fire and therefore prevented it from the destroying the whole city of Paris.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Nonverbal_spell" title="Nonverbal spell">Nonverbal magic</a></b>: Newt was shown to be fully capable of using magic non-verbally, a testament to his actually considerable magical skills. He was able to summon an Occamy egg held in Jacob Kowalski's hand without saying the incantation, ending up sending Jacob flying towards him at great speed, turn a window opening into a jelly-like substance to trap his <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Niffler</a>, use a mind-altering spell on muggles that saw his creatures break out of Jacob Kowalski's apartment, and also aid Yusuf, Nicolas, Theseus and Tina in containing the blue fire left by Grindelwald without speaking a word. He also proved quite capable of wordlessly using offensive and defensive magic spells, such as when he deflected Grindelwald's attacks and countered with his own as well as conjured a lasso of a gelatinous substance to restrain Grindelwald after distracting him with his <a href="/wiki/Swooping_Evil" title="Swooping Evil">Swooping Evil</a> and later held off Grindelwald's blue fire alongside Theseus without speaking a word.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Apparition</a></b>: Newt was able to successfully Apparate in many different situations, although he seemed more skilled than most, as he avoided the violent attacks from an <a href="/wiki/Obscurus" title="Obscurus">Obscurus</a> as well as <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Herbology" title="Herbology">Herbology</a></b>: Newt was also proficient in looking after magical flora and was familiar with their properties, keeping several potted plants on a shelf in his shed in the magically expanded <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander%27s_suitcase" title="Newton Scamander&#39;s suitcase">suitcase</a>. After <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Kowalski" title="Jacob Kowalski">Jacob Kowalski</a> suffered a "slightly more severe reaction" than Newt had known anyone else to have after he was was bitten by a <a href="/wiki/Murtlap" title="Murtlap">Murtlap</a> that escaped Newt's case, Newt used plants and the contents of various bottles to create a poultice, and successfully stopped the <a href="/wiki/No-Maj" class="mw-redirect" title="No-Maj">No-Maj</a>'s fever-like sweating.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Healing_magic" title="Healing magic">Healing magic</a></b>: Newt was quite adept and knowledgeable in Healing Magic, as he could easily recognise and identify the nature of and prepare medicinal remedies to cure the symptoms of creature-induced injuries, such as he did when he treated <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Kowalski" title="Jacob Kowalski">Jacob Kowalski</a>'s bite from a <a href="/wiki/Murtlap" title="Murtlap">Murtlap</a> and the subsequent symptoms. He also had various pills for the same purpose available and knew which ones had what effects upon consumption.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Potion" title="Potion">Potions</a></b>: Newt was also very knowledgeable and accomplished in potions, particularly those that used parts of magical creatures as ingredients, writing down hints about it in his books and also successfully experimenting with novel potions such as uses for <a href="/wiki/Swooping_Evil_venom" title="Swooping Evil venom">Swooping Evil venom</a>. He was also capable of successfully brewing the complex <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a> in order to disguise himself as his brother, a particularly complex and advanced brew, showing his impressive abilities in this field.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">Duelling</a></b>: Beguiling his peaceful disposition, Newt wielded superb duelling skills, being considerably proficient with both offensive and defensive spells. He seamlessly used the <a href="/wiki/Full_Body-Bind_Curse" title="Full Body-Bind Curse">Full Body-Bind Curse</a> on No-Maj <a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Bingley" title="Gilbert Bingley">Gilbert Bingley</a> upon nearly being arrested. Later he was, with some good help from his <a href="/wiki/Swooping_Evil" title="Swooping Evil">Swooping Evil</a>, able to evade capture by multiple trained <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a>. He even managed to briefly stay in magical combat with the extraordinarily powerful <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a> himself when he was disguised as <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a>, avoiding an oncoming curse after being knocked down and firing a white offensive spell at him in return, although it was easily deflected, for a time repelling Grindelwald's attacks, before being swiftly knocked down by a particularly powerful shock wave of electricity but still able to hold off Grindelwald's attempts to torture him by blue lightning bolts, lasting long enough for Credence to distract Grindelwald and having not suffered any noteworthy injury, Newt managed to blind-side and subdue the aforementioned Dark Wizard from behind when he was preoccupied fighting against a small army of MACUSA Aurors. Even Torquil Travers seem to begrudgingly acknowledged Newt's duelling skills, as he asked Newt to be an Auror and alongside the other committee members, was willing to give him the dangerous mission of slaying the extremely powerful <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a> and Theseus seemed sure Newt was proficient enough to be a seasoned one and able to accomplish such a feat. He later on easily defeated a Ministry agent watching him and during Grindelwald's rally in Paris, Newt defeated many of Grindelwald's allies and was able to go up against the Dark Wizard himself for a time alongside Leta, Theseus and his future wife. He would also go on to participate in the <a href="/wiki/Global_Wizarding_War" class="mw-redirect" title="Global Wizarding War">Global Wizarding War</a> hunting down Grindelwald and his followers and survived for years until its end.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/History_of_Magic" title="History of Magic">History of Magic</a></b>: Newt also had knowledge of magical history, especially of Magizoology. A whole chapter of <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i> was devoted to the definitions of <a href="/wiki/Beast" title="Beast">beasts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Being" title="Being">beings</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Spirit" title="Spirit">spirits</a> and how the definitions have evolved in past centuries.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Muggle_Studies" title="Muggle Studies">Muggle Studies</a></b>: Newt was considerably adept at the subject, as shown by his ability to flawlessly interact with Muggles of many countries while on his adventures. He had particular knowledge on the history of Muggles related to Beasts as well as how Muggles reacted to magical creatures and how beasts included in muggle fairy tales, like fairies, differed from real ones. He also knew about Muggles' awareness of Diricawl and that they believed that they hunted it to extinction. A whole chapter in his book was about Muggle awareness of beasts. He also claims to Jacob that the bodies of Muggles react differently to magic and gives him some armour when dealing with a <a href="/wiki/Erumpent" title="Erumpent">Erumpent</a> for protection.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Wandlore" title="Wandlore">Wandlore</a></b>: Newt had some knowledge of the properties of <a href="/wiki/Wand_core" title="Wand core">wand cores</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Thunderbird_tail_feather" title="Thunderbird tail feather">Thunderbird tail feathers</a>.</li>
<li><b>Indomitable willpower</b>: Newt, despite his awkwardness, wielded immense willpower and bravery. He proved himself to be fully capable of standing up to others when needed, even if they were of high authority, as shown by how he adamantly refused to hunt down <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a> when asked to by <a href="/wiki/Torquil_Travers" title="Torquil Travers">Torquil Travers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Guzman" title="Arnold Guzman">Arnold Guzman</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_Spielman" title="Rudolph Spielman">Rudolph Spielman</a> despite their offer to restore his right to travel and despite being bound, was quick to stand up to <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a> disguise when he insinuated that Newt was working <a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">For the Greater Good</a>, something that actually impressed the <a href="/wiki/Dark_wizard" class="mw-redirect" title="Dark wizard">Dark wizard</a>. Indeed, he was admired by <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> himself for his uncanny willingness to do what is right no matter the cost and, despite seeing horrific visions of a future <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, Newt demonstrated his incorruptible spirit and morals by resisting Grindelwald's persuasive speech, instead valiantly fighting against the Dark wizard's <a href="/wiki/Protego_Diabolica" title="Protego Diabolica">black fire</a>, and, inspired by <a href="/wiki/Leta_Lestrange" title="Leta Lestrange">Leta</a>'s sacrifice, officially joining the <a href="/wiki/Global_Wizarding_War" class="mw-redirect" title="Global Wizarding War">Global Wizarding War</a> efforts against him.</li></ul>

<dd></dd></dl></div><p>Newt's confident, successful and worldly older brother was, in so many ways, the polar opposite to Newt himself, and the two of them have a very complex relationship. The relationship between the two of them as children is unknown, but the fact that they chose woefully different career paths is a hint that their differences went back as far as childhood. Newt resented Theseus for earning the love of his life, Leta Lestrange, but at the same time is not openly hostile towards him.
</p><p>It is hinted that Newt has always held some resentment against Theseus, as when Tina Goldstein overpowers Theseus in Paris, Newt remarks that witnessing it may be the greatest moment of his life. Despite this, Theseus is extremely civil and even affectionate towards Newt, hugging him on several occasions, though Newt is fiercely uncomfortable with this. The two of them appear capable of putting aside their differences when push comes to shove, as the two of them fight side-by-side very effectively in Paris when battling against Grindelwald. The relationship finally got mended after the battle, as Newt actually comforts Theseus after Leta's death (as Leta was someone they both cared immensely about) and reveals that he has finally chosen a side to fight on. Later, Theseus persuades the other Aurors to allow Newt and Dumbledore to speak alone.

<dd></dd></dl></div><p>Tina was arguably the love of Newt's life. The two got off to a bad start after she followed Newt around while he caused trouble in a bank, and she kept having to demand that he take action since he clearly didn't want to. Eventually, not knowing his suitcase had been accidentally swapped with Jacob's, she turned him in to MACUSA for the threat he was unintentionally posing to New York. When Percival Graves saw confectionery instead of magical beasts while checking the suitcase, they left the MACUSA building together to find New's suitcase. When they did it, Tina offered Newt accommodation in her and her sister's apartment, but it didn't improve their relationship much, especially since Goldstein did it only because of the sick Jacob Kowalski, who had been bitten by one of the beasts which escaped from the suitcase, and also to be able to keep an eye on Newt.
</p><p>However, after they were both arrested and Newt saved her life, their relationship began to improve, as Tina began to understand why a man could depend on magical beasts. With time, Newt became more and more conscious of Tina's virtues, seeing that she was a good-hearted person and that her previous desire to report his misdeeds to the superiors might have resulted from ignorance and willingness to prove that she could return to an Auror position. Quests to search for the lost magical beasts, as well as their joint efforts while trying to defeat the Obscurus and even the capture of Gellert Grindelwald (while disguised Percival Graves), brought the two closer together. After the capture of Grindelwald, Newt told Seraphina Picquery about Tina's actions, which resulted in her being restored as an Auror, for which Tina was extremely grateful to him. At the time of his departure, Newt said he was going to publish <a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">a book</a> and Tina briefly asked him if <a href="/wiki/Leta_Lestrange" title="Leta Lestrange">Leta Lestrange</a>, the girl he once loved, liked to read. Newt only answered that he didn't really know what Leta liked these days, because people changed - and he had probably changed too. Tina promised to buy his book, and joyfully accepted when Newt asked if he could come back and give her a copy in person.
</p><p>Due to his subsequent travel ban, Newt couldn't return to visit Tina and give her the book, so he had corresponded with her by letter, but a series of missteps on Newt's part, namely his accidental denunciation of Aurors as "career-driven hypocrites", had soured the relationship. Their relationship got even colder when Tina read an article in <a href="/wiki/Spellbound" title="Spellbound">Spellbound</a>, which had reported on the launch party of <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i> and falsely stated that Newt was engaged to Leta Lestrange.<b> </b>The belief that Newt had rekindled his relationship with Leta was too much for Tina, and she broke off contact with Newt and started seeing a fellow Auror named Achilles Tolliver. When he learned that Credence had survived and Grindelwald escaped from MACUSA's prison in order to find him, Newt was ordered by Albus Dumbledore to go to Paris, where Credence was believed to be hiding. Newt refused, but when he learned from Queenie that Tina was also there to find Credence, he travelled to France without hesitation. Newt was determined to have Tina learn the truth, although she remained cold with him, insisting on calling him "Mr Scamander". Nevertheless, Newt eventually managed to subtly confess his feelings for her, awkwardly stating that she had "eyes like a <a href="/wiki/Fire_Dwelling_Salamander" title="Fire Dwelling Salamander">salamander</a>". The two worked together once again when Grindelwald was summoning his followers.
</p><p>Newt and Tina got married at some point after the 1920s, and had at least one child, likely a son.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup> In the 1990s, Newt and Tina were living together in Dorset with their three pet <a href="/wiki/Kneazle" title="Kneazle">Kneazles</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hoppy" title="Hoppy">Hoppy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Milly" title="Milly">Milly</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mauler" title="Mauler">Mauler</a>, and had at least one grandson, <a href="/wiki/Rolf_Scamander" title="Rolf Scamander">Rolf Scamander</a>.

<p>Newt's relationship with Albus Dumbledore was very close. During Newt's time at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, Dumbledore was his <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> Professor and among the very few who didn't look down on him, which started Newt's respect for the great professor. When one of <a href="/wiki/Leta_Lestrange" title="Leta Lestrange">Leta Lestrange</a>'s experiments involving a magical beast went too far, endangering the life of another student. Newt did not want to see a friend thrown out of school, so he took the blame for Leta's actions, and was thus sentenced to be expelled from Hogwarts in her place. Newt developed unending trust and loyalty to Dumbledore after he argued strongly against his expulsion. It is unclear whether the expulsion was enforced or not, or if it was temporary or permanent. However, Newt was allowed to keep his wand.
</p><p>After school Newt probably was in a regular contact with his teacher. Newt respected his mentor enough to do tasks for him. Dumbledore told him where to find one ill-bred <a href="/wiki/Thunderbird" title="Thunderbird">Thunderbird</a> and later sent his former student to <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> to release this beast, whose natural environment was <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>. At this time Newt helped capture <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a>, who was trying to convince <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">Obscurial</a> <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a> to join his ranks. Newt was extremely loyal to Dumbledore, because when he appealed to his travel ban, he lied to the committee members that he had gone to the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">United States</a> on his orders. When Grindelwald managed to escape, Albus felt that he would not be able to fight the dark wizard, so he asked Scamander for help. Dumbledore admired him, because he didn't care about power or popularity, something that Newt did not understand as he was not aware of Dumbledore's past that made him realise his initial views was a foolish man's dream and that Dumbledore meant Newt could have become a leader even greater than himself. He sent Newt to <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> to rescue Credence, who survived battle in New York, but Newt was reluctant, nevertheless he was willing to accept the address of a <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel" title="Nicolas Flamel">safe-house</a>. The rumours of Newton's potential travel to <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> reached the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">British Ministry of Magic</a>, and a delegation, including Newt's brother <a href="/wiki/Theseus_Scamander" title="Theseus Scamander">Theseus Scamander</a>, Leta Lestrange and <a href="/wiki/Torquil_Travers" title="Torquil Travers">Torquil Travers</a>, was sent to Hogwarts Castle to question Dumbledore. Albus only pretended that he did not know anything about it and said that Newt is not a great follower of orders. During the <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_Paris_rally" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s Paris rally">Battle in Lestrange family Mausoleum</a>, vial of Dumbledore's and Grindelwald's <a href="/wiki/Blood_pact" title="Blood pact">blood pact</a> was stolen from Grindelwald, however, without his knowledge by a <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Niffler</a> belonging to Newt Scamander. Shortly thereafter Scamander brought it to Dumbledore at Hogwarts. Dumbledore expressed regret at Leta's death in mausoleum. Newt in turn did not ask Dumbledore why he would form a blood pact with Grindelwald but simply asked him to destroy it, showing respect for his privacy. Although it apparently took years, Dumbledore clearly managed to abolish the blood pact, allowing him to finally defeat Grindelwald in a legendary duel.

<dd></dd></dl></div><p>The friendship between Newt and Jacob was the result of a pure luck encounter, as they both found themselves in the same bank, albeit for different reasons. Jacob was associated with Newt's quest for his lost creatures from the beginning, as he inadvertently took Newt's magical case full of creatures instead of his own, causing the escape of some magical beasts. Newt finally found Jacob, who had been bitten by a <a href="/wiki/Murtlap" title="Murtlap">Murtlap</a>, and agreed to remain with the No-Maj until he was healed. Over the dinner they had with <a href="/wiki/Porpentina_Goldstein" title="Porpentina Goldstein">Tina</a> and <a href="/wiki/Queenie_Goldstein" title="Queenie Goldstein">Queenie Goldstein</a>, Newt remarked how easy it was for Jacob to be appreciated by people, something Newt had trouble with since most people found him annoying. Newt and Jacob progressively bonded with each other, and once they successfully recaptured an <a href="/wiki/Erumpent" title="Erumpent">Erumpent</a>, Newt was told by Jacob to call him by his first name instead of "Mr Kowalski". In the aftermath of the arrest of <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a> in New York, while Jacob was on the verge of being obliviated, he asked Newt why he had kept him around for so long, to which Newt simply replied that he liked Jacob and considered him a friend.
</p><p>Newt and Jacob reconnected months later, and Newt immediately sensed that something was wrong with Jacob, who was under the influence of a spell by Queenie. Newt demanded that Jacob was released from the spell in order to freely make his own choices. Newt and Jacob teamed up once again in the former's quest for <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a>, the two of them mentioning how difficult their relationships with the women they loved (Tina and Queenie) could be.

<dd></dd></dl></div><p>Queenie met Newt when he, along with Jacob Kowalski, were brought to her apartment by her sister Tina. The man at first a bit reluctantly accepted Queenie's hospitality, but he did not refuse her and put up at their home. Their relationship quickly warmed and the woman joined in helping to catch the beasts that escaped from his suitcase. Queenie helped to transport Newt, Tina and Jacob from MACUSA, and she volunteered to stop the Obscurus threatening the city. When Queenie found out that he missed Leta Lestrange, she consoled him that she could only take, and he deserved someone better. Scamander couldn't fully open himself to Queenie, and the awareness of her magical reading skills in the mind drank him. Nevertheless, they had good relationships and could rely on each other.
</p><p>Months later, Queenie with Jacob visited Newt in London. Newt was sad seeing that Tina didn't come with them and Queenie informed him that Tina was in Paris to look for Credence Barebone. She stated that her sister is heartbroken and showed him a copy of Spellbound magazine which ran a mistaken cover story on Newt's supposed engagement to Leta Lestrange. Queenie stated that she doesn't talk with her sister and tell magizoologist that she and Jacob were engaged and planned to be married. Newt realised that No-Maj was under a powerful love charm. Newt started arguing with Queenie that if Jacob loves her, no spells are needed, so Newt lifted the spell. Jacob refused to marry her, in fear of Queenie would be punished for marriage with him. As a result of this, Queenie felt betrayed by Newt and Jacob, so she left London and headed to Paris to find Tina, leaving two men in quest to find both sisters in France. During Grindelwald's rally in Lestrange family Mausoleum, Queenie joined the dark wizard's side, which saddened Newt.

<dd></dd></dl></div><p>Being the reigning Dark Wizard of Newt's time, Newt had heard a lot about Grindelwald and already strongly disapproved, of his views but he did not support the Ministry's act against him. Unbeknownst to him at first, he would meet Grindelwald while he was disguised as Percival Graves in New York. Grindelwald, not impressed by Newt's love for creatures or his magical skills, questioned him on why Dumbledore would be fond of him despite his unique traits, having known of Dumbledore's strong argument on Newt's expulsion, although Newt did not know why himself. Grindelwald seemed to have wanted to continue to talk about Dumbledore. Newt quickly began to dislike Grindelwald's reminder of his expulsion at Hogwarts and this increased even further when Grindelwald indicated Newt was working for the Greater Good, causing him to outrageously say that he wasn't one of Grindelwald's fanatics, which surprisingly not only didn't offend the Dark Wizard but even caused him to be amused, when he did not know Grindelwald was impersonating Graves. When Grindelwald slipped up by saying the hostless Obscurus was useless, Newt expressed disgust at what Graves could possibly use it for. It remains unknown what Grindelwald would have done to Newt had the conversation continued. Newt knew that he intended to use him and his friends (Tina, Jacob, and Queenie) as scapegoats for the Obscurus attacks. When Newt intervened in Grindelwald's plan to acquire Credence Barebone, Grindelwald dropped all pretence and ferociously attacked Newt, duelling and even torturing him with lightning spells in a fit of rage. Newt managed to capture Grindelwald by use of Swooping Evil and revealed his true identity to MACUSA, but before being carried off Grindelwald turned to Newt and said mysteriously "Will we die, just a little?", possibly as a message for Dumbledore due to his knowing Newt's closeness to Dumbledore.
</p><p>Newt did not initially want to oppose Grindelwald, as he did not take sides. Grindelwald encountered Newt once more in Paris, during which Grindelwald's only exchange was asking Newt whether Dumbledore would mourn for him. Newt, however, did survive the battle but Grindelwald's murder of Leta left Newt with a strong hatred for him and he chose to side against him during the Global Wizarding War at last.
</p><p>Grindelwald’s hatred of Newt appears to come, in part, from his jealousy of Dumbledore’s care and admiration of the gifted young man. The Dark Wizard’s mocking of Dumbledore’s affection for him in the Lestrange Mausoleum Is a hint at this, indicating the idea of Dumbledore having someone else other than Grindelwald to love infuriates him. Although the two former lovers now operate on two completely different ideologies, Grindelwald still feels that Dumbledore’s attention should be on himself alone.

<dd></dd></dl></div><p>Due to both of them being outcasts and both of them loving magical creatures, Newt quickly befriended Leta and later fell in love with her, to the extent that he took the blame when Leta's experiments endangered a student and he was expelled. Although this left Newt bitter, he still loved Leta, keeping a picture of her in his suitcase, but was clearly resentful of how Leta never tried to contact him again, to the point of briefly lashing out at Queenie for reading his mind. This bitterness only increased when Leta and Theseus became engaged and he refused to interact with both of them at once. However, it cannot be denied that Newt still loved her deep down despite his growing feelings for Tina, as he still agreed to be the best man at the wedding and defended her from her self-hatred when she revealed her part in Corvus's death, looking solemn when she stated that he had "never met a monster he couldn't love", referring to herself. Her sacrifice devastated Newt and he was inspired to join the Global Wizarding War in her honour.

<ul><li><i>Newton</i> is derived from the Old English place name meaning "new town" and was originally a surname. The most eminent historical figure with this surname is Sir Isaac Newton, who, while known largely for his contributions to the fields of mathematics and physics, also wrote many works on alchemy. Some of his writings suggest he was attempting to create a <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a><sup id="cite_ref-Isaac_Newton_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Isaac_Newton-42">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup>, inspired by the real <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel" title="Nicolas Flamel">Nicolas Flamel</a>.</li>
<li><i>Artemis</i> (Ἄρτεμις) was a goddess in Greek mythology, the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess of the moon, hunting, the wilderness, and the gift of taming wild animals. In myth, Artemis spends most of her time hunting, which she has in common with Newt, although he seeks wild animals for conservation rather than sport.</li>
<li><i>Fido</i> is of Latin origin, meaning "I trust" or "faithful". The name Fido is most commonly associated with being a common name for pet dogs in many countries.</li>
<li><i>Scamander</i> is very similar to the word salamander, which is a type of real-world amphibian. In the wizarding world, <a href="/wiki/Fire_Dwelling_Salamander" title="Fire Dwelling Salamander">salamanders</a> are small lizards which feed on flames. Newts are also a type of salamander.</li>
<li>Scamander (Σκάμανδρος) is a river god in Greek mythology. The Scamander River (now known as the Karamenderes) flows over where the Trojan War was fought, according to Homer's Iliad.</li>
<li>Each of his four names are most likely referencing animals, due to his love for them.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)" title="Harry Potter (film series)"><i>Harry Potter</i> films</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Portrait" title="Portrait">portrait</a> of Scamander is present in the <a href="/wiki/Headmaster%27s_office" class="mw-redirect" title="Headmaster&#39;s office">Headmaster's office</a>, thus implying that he was a past <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Headmaster" title="Hogwarts Headmaster">Headmaster of Hogwarts</a> and that he had died at some point in the more ambiguous present day timeline of the films.</li>
<li>Interestingly, the portrait of Newt Scamander mentioned above bears the monogram of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Albrecht Dürer">Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528)</a>. Dürer's dates do not match those of Scamander the slightest. The portrait itself seems to have been based on a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/The_Marquess_of_Argyll.jpg">17th-century portrait of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll</a>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scougall" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:David Scougall">David Scougall</a>.</li>
<li>In <a href="/wiki/2001" title="2001">2001</a>, <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> published a <a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(companion_book)" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (companion book)">real</a> version of <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i> for <a href="/wiki/Comic_Relief" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a>, a UK based charity event. The book was written from an in-universe perspective, and Scamander was credited as the "author" of the book. The original book was updated in 2017 after the character appeared as the star character in the film <a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them_(film)" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)">named directly after it</a>.</li>
<li>Newt was the first known Hufflepuff introduced in the series, although this information was not revealed until <i><a href="/wiki/Pottermore" title="Pottermore">Pottermore</a></i> clarified his house.</li>
<li>When <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i> was originally translated into German, Newt's name was translated as "Lurch" Scamander. Lurch is a German word for amphibians, a family of animals the newt is also part of. When <i>Fantastic Beasts</i> was translated, his original first name was untranslated instead and Lurch was one of his middle names. This makes his full name in the German version "Newton Artemis Fido Lurch Scamander".
<ul><li>Similarly, in the French version of the Harry Potter books, he is named "Norbert Dragonneau" (Dragonneau meaning baby dragon), a possible foreshadowing to <a href="/wiki/Norberta" title="Norberta">Norberta</a>. In the translation of <i>Fantastic Beasts</i>, however, it is said that this is actually a pen name, and the book uses his original name the rest of the time. Even though it's a pen name, the name "Norbert Dragonneau" is used in the French and French Canadian versions of the first film of <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>While never specifically confirmed to play <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Mary_Lou_Barebone" title="Mary Lou Barebone">Mary Lou Barebone</a> asks him if he is a "<a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">seeker</a> of truth," he replies "I'm more of a <a href="/wiki/Chaser" title="Chaser">chaser</a>, really."</li>
<li>While using the swooping evil to catch Grindelwald in the film version, the screenplay for the films states that he uses his wand.</li>
<li>Originally the visual artists crafted expansive environments for all the creatures in Newt's case; however, J.K. Rowling informed that he wasn't that great of a wizard and they scaled them down to be backdrops creating a sufficient semblance of the creatures' natural habitats.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Strangely, despite Newt being shown to be a loyal ally of Dumbledore as well as having played several key roles against Grindelwald, there is no mention of Newt having participated in either the First or Second Wizarding Wars against Lord Voldemort. He does not appear in the photograph of the original Order of the Phoenix and is not mentioned by Alastor Moody when showing the photograph to Harry. There is a chance however that he merely wasn't present for that particular photo and that he simply never encountered Harry.</li>
<li>It's possible that Newt attended Dumbledore's funeral in <i>The Half Blood Prince</i> and was unnamed, as it is stated that Harry did not recognise the majority of wizards who attended.</li>
<li>When asked by a fan about why Dumbledore would send Newt to take down Grindelwald when experienced aurors couldn't do it J.K. Rowling said that she could write an essay but that it would give away the whole plot of the Fantastic Beasts franchise.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup></li>

<ul><li>J.K. Rowling also confirmed Newt would remain the main character.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup></li></ul></li>
<li>Newt has four distinctive scars on his left hand resembling a <a href="/wiki/Murtlap" title="Murtlap">Murtlap</a> bite. This would explain how Newt knew what a "bad reaction" entailed, since no wizards before Newt dared to go near a Murtlap.</li>
<li>Eddie Redmayne has stated that he thinks that Newt is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism">autistic</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> This would be consistent with Newt's disregard for many social norms, aversion to physical or eye contact, and firm sense of who he is, not to mention his own single-minded focus on his topics of perseverance and penchant for unorthodox solutions to daunting tasks.</li>
<li>Although having had been suggested in the novels that if a student is expelled from Hogwarts, his wand will be broken,<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">&#91;50&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">&#91;51&#93;</a></sup> Newt has a wand and frequently uses it.
<ul><li>Anyway, both Hagrid and Harry Potter, whose expulsion was reconsidered by the Ministry, were expelled after Newt. It might be possible that the Ministry introduced this particular law between 1914 circa (date of Newt's expulsion) and 1942/43, as Newt was allowed to keep his wand.<sup id="cite_ref-jkr-snitchseeker_16-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jkr-snitchseeker-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup></li></ul></li></ul>
