Minerva attended <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> and was Sorted into <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor House</a>, but it took the Sorting Hat five and a half minutes to decide if she was Gryffindor or <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a>, which made her a <a href="/wiki/Hatstall" title="Hatstall">Hatstall</a>. During her seventh year, she was appointed <a href="/wiki/Head_Boy_or_Girl" title="Head Boy or Girl">Head Girl</a>.

</p><p>Eventually, Minerva became concurrently, at differing times, <a href="/wiki/Deputy_Headmaster" title="Deputy Headmaster">Deputy Headmistress</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Headmaster" title="Hogwarts Headmaster">Headmistress of Hogwarts</a>.

<p>Minerva McGonagall was born on <a href="/wiki/4_October" title="4 October">4 October</a> to <a href="/wiki/Robert_McGonagall_Senior" title="Robert McGonagall Senior">Robert McGonagall</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> <a href="/wiki/Presbyterianism" title="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> minister, and his wife <a href="/wiki/Isobel_Ross" title="Isobel Ross">Isobel Ross</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">witch</a>. She was the couple's first child and was named after <a href="/wiki/Minerva" title="Minerva">her mother's grandmother</a>, a very powerful witch. By then, her parents lived on the outskirts of <a href="/wiki/Caithness" title="Caithness">Caithness</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scottish Highlands</a>, in a village where mostly Muggles lived.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Her birth proved both a joy and a crisis: Isobel had given up the use of her <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a> for her love of Robert and never told him about her <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">nature</a> as she was afraid to mar the bliss of their wedding. However, the infant Minerva displayed small but noticeable signs of magic from her earliest hours. She had <a href="/wiki/Underage_magic" title="Underage magic">no control of her magic</a> and thus inadvertently <a href="/wiki/Summoning_Charm" title="Summoning Charm">summoned</a> toys that had been left on upper shelves to her cot, made the <a href="/wiki/McGonagalls%27_cat" title="McGonagalls&#39; cat">family cat</a> do her bidding, and her<a href="/wiki/Robert_McGonagall_Snr%27s_bagpipes" title="Robert McGonagall Snr&#39;s bagpipes"> father's bagpipes</a> play themselves which would cause her to chuckle happily. Thus, Isobel often secluded herself with Minerva for days at a time. She knew she must confess to her husband about their daughter's <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizarding abilities</a> and so she finally did, explaining everything to Robert and telling him that they were bound by the <a href="/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy" title="International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy">International Statute of Secrecy</a> and that they must conceal the truth about their magical abilities for their safety.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The two parents remained together despite the shocking revelation, but their trust never was the same, much to the sadness of their perceptive daughter. She later had two brothers, <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_McGonagall" title="Malcolm McGonagall">Malcolm</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_McGonagall_Junior" title="Robert McGonagall Junior">Robert Jnr</a>, who revealed magical ability in due course. As a child, Minerva helped her mother conceal from her father the accidents and embarrassments the young witch's magic sometimes caused. She was very close to her Muggle father, whom in temperament she resembled more than her mother.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>On Minerva's eleventh birthday, Minerva received her <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_acceptance_letter" title="Hogwarts acceptance letter">admittance letter</a> from <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, at the time <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">headed</a> by <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a> <a href="/wiki/Armando_Dippet" title="Armando Dippet">Armando Dippet</a>. Before coming to the school, she visited <a href="/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a> and purchased her wand from <a href="/wiki/Ollivanders" title="Ollivanders">Ollivander's</a> Wand Shop. The <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall%27s_wand" title="Minerva McGonagall&#39;s wand">wand</a> she selected was an unusual specimen, 9 and a half inches, <a href="/wiki/Fir" title="Fir">fir</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dragon_heartstring" title="Dragon heartstring">dragon heartstring</a>. Now free to be with her kind and to exercise her talents, Minerva saw how her mother sobbed that day, not only out of pride, but also out of envy.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

Minerva's school career overlapped by two years with that of <a href="/wiki/Pomona_Sprout" title="Pomona Sprout">Pomona Sprout</a>, and the two students enjoyed an excellent relationship, both then and in later years.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>After graduating from Hogwarts, Minerva was offered a position at the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement">Department of Magical Law Enforcement</a> of the British <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>. She returned to her <a href="/wiki/McGonagall_manse" title="McGonagall manse">family's manse</a> to spend one last summer with her family before moving to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. During these months an eighteen-years old Minerva met <a href="/wiki/Dougal_McGregor" title="Dougal McGregor">Dougal McGregor</a>, a local <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a>, who was the handsome, clever, and funny son of a <a href="/wiki/Dougal_McGregor%27s_father" title="Dougal McGregor&#39;s father">local farmer</a>. The two shared a sense of humour, argued fiercely, and suspected mysterious depths in each other. Minerva fell head-over-heels in <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a> with McGregor, being the first and only time in her life that she might have been said to lose her head. Eventually, McGregor proposed to Minerva on a ploughed field and she accepted his offer.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>That night, however, Minerva was unable to tell her parents of her engagement. Thinking about her future, she realised that wedding a <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> who didn't know that she was a witch would mean Minerva would follow her mother's footsteps and live unhappily with her wand locked away, shredding all of her ambitions. Early next morning, Minerva went to tell McGregor she had changed her mind and could not <a href="/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marry</a> him, aware that if she broke the International Statute of Secrecy and told him why, she would lose the job at the Ministry for which she was giving him up. She could give him no good reason for her change of heart, leaving McGregor devastated and left for <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> three days later.

<p>Though her feelings for the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> were affected by the fact that she had recently suffered an emotional crisis, Minerva didn't much enjoy her home in London and workplace, where some of her co-workers had an ingrained anti-Muggle bias.

Despite this, Minerva was among the most efficient, gifted employees in the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement">Department of Magical Law Enforcement</a> and became fond of her much older boss, <a href="/wiki/Elphinstone_Urquart" title="Elphinstone Urquart">Elphinstone Urquart</a>.

<p>Instead, Minerva sent an owl to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, asking whether she might be considered for a teaching post. The owl returned within hours, offering her a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore. Through her efforts and work, Minerva proved to be a inspirational yet strict teacher, maintaining control of her students with a stern hand that made her someone not to be crossed.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>By this time, Minerva was shocked to learn from her oblivious mother (in the middle of a chatty letter of local news) that Dougal had married the daughter of another farmer. Albus discovered his former student and colleague in tears in her classroom late that evening, and she confessed the whole story to him. He offered both comfort and told Minerva some of his own family history, previously unknown to her. The confidences exchanged that night between were to form the basis of a lasting friendship.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Among her first students were <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a> and <a href="/wiki/Leta_Lestrange" title="Leta Lestrange">Leta Lestrange</a>, the latter of whom was frequently in trouble with Minerva for retaliating to vicious gossip about her <a href="/wiki/Corvus_Lestrange_(V)" title="Corvus Lestrange (V)">half-brother</a>'s death. A notable example of this is when Leta hexed a fellow student with the dark charm <i><a href="/wiki/Oscausi" title="Oscausi">Oscausi</a></i> during her third year, after the other girl had been speaking ill of Leta behind her back. Minerva was called upon to fix the situation, but Leta ran from her and Minerva was forced to chase her around the school, all the while docking points (Minerva ended up docking a total of 200 points). When she couldn't find Leta, Minerva removed the spell from the girl but promptly restored it with an irritated "Whisht!" when the girl continued to badmouth Leta.<sup id="cite_ref-COGS_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COGS-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>During Gellert Grindelwald's rise, Minerva still taught at Hogwarts and was a close confidant to Dumbledore. She was quite critical of the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>'s involvement at Hogwarts and was furious when <a href="/wiki/Torquil_Travers" title="Torquil Travers">Torquil Travers</a> and a team of <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> interrupted Dumbledore's <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> lesson, protesting that this was "a school."

<p>After the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a> had ended, Minerva continued on with her career at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, carrying on teaching the art of Transfiguration. Elphinstone, who had never ceased to love her, proposed every now and then until she finally accepted after Dougal's death. Their engagement happened during a summertime stroll around the lake in the Hogwarts grounds. The retired Elphinstone bought a small cottage for the two of them in Hogsmeade, whence Minerva could travel easily to work every day. Although the couple had no children, her nieces and nephews visited often. This was a period of great fulfilment for Minerva.
</p><p>In 1985, three years into their marriage, Elphinstone died from a <a href="/wiki/Venomous_Tentacula" title="Venomous Tentacula">Venomous Tentacula</a> bite.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Minerva, who couldn't bear to remain alone in their cottage, packed her things after her husband's funeral and returned to her first-floor study in Hogwarts Castle. It is unknown whether she still owns the cottage. Always a brave and private person, Minerva poured all her energies into her work and few people – excepting perhaps Albus – ever realised how much she suffered.
</p><p>During the second year of the <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">sibling</a> of <a href="/wiki/Jacob_(Hogwarts_student)" title="Jacob (Hogwarts student)">Jacob</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Ben_Copper" title="Ben Copper">Ben Copper</a> when missing, the individual asked Minerva about it as she was the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_House" title="Head of House">Head of the Gryffindor House</a>. She first asked if Jacob's sibling had seen him in the Hogwarts Express and if he had been acting strange and after learning that they didn't but <a href="/wiki/Penny_Haywood" title="Penny Haywood">Penny Haywood</a> did and Ben seemed fine even though he was always a bit odd. She mentioned that the <a href="/wiki/Cursed_ice" title="Cursed ice">Cursed ice</a> may have changed Ben and slightly chastised Jacob's sibling for their attempt to enter the <a href="/wiki/Cursed_Vaults" title="Cursed Vaults">Cursed Vault</a>, asking them if they had learnt anything that said of a threat beyond the door and appealed to them that this involved all of Hogwarts, not just Jacob. Learning that they had found and read a message about an <a href="/wiki/Ice_Knight" title="Ice Knight">Ice Knight</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vanished_Stairs" title="Vanished Stairs">Vanished Stairs</a>, Minerva said she will discuss this with Dumbledore and accidentally revealed that she and the other teachers had once dealt with the Cursed Ice, which she quickly covered by telling Jacob's sibling that he is free to help in the search of Ben and ask for him to tell her personally should he succeed, promising to reward him.<sup id="cite_ref-HM_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Sometime later, Minerva asked for Jacob sibling's help to find Gryffindor Broom Wax which had been misplaced by the keeper should they be a Gryffindor. Accompanying Jacob's sibling to the Common Room, she congratulated them for their success and gave them twenty House Points for their effort. Later, impressed by their transfiguration talents, McGonagall offered to give them advanced transfiguration classes.<sup id="cite_ref-HM_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>If they were of another house and tried to infiltrate the Gryffindor Common Room, Minerva would catch them with Angelica but as they searched for Ben, she allowed them to get away unpunished. McGonagall and Snape eventually found the missing Ben Copper encased in Cursed ice and Jacob's Sibling and Rowan realised she knew more about the Cursed Ice than she revealed. Minerva was perplexed that the <a href="/wiki/Knockback_Jinx" title="Knockback Jinx">Knockback Jinx</a> had no effect on the ice, noting on how they once could use it to shatter the ice, and even more so when Snape callously suggested they use <a href="/wiki/Fire-Making_Spell" title="Fire-Making Spell">Incendio</a> to melt the ice while also burning him to death, as she realises from how the Cursed Ice had began to expand throughout the school that someone had been tampering with the Vaults. Ignoring Snape's frustrated questioning of Dumbledore's whereabouts, Minerva and Snape used the <a href="/wiki/Fire-Making_Spell" title="Fire-Making Spell">Fire-Making Spell</a> to successfully free Ben from the Cursed Ice, taking care to target as further as possible from his body.<sup id="cite_ref-HM_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Knowing Minerva was the only one left in the school with Dumbledore gone that could possibly teach them the <a href="/wiki/Revelio_Charm" title="Revelio Charm">Revelio Charm</a>, Jacob's Sibling turned to her to learn the spell. At first Minerva was baffled due to how advanced the charm was but ultimately agreed to teach them if they proved themselves sufficiently adept, impressed by their desire to help Hogwarts and study Transfiguration. Finding their abilities to have reached the level required in the class, Minerva called them to have their private lesson and after Jacob's sibling successfully learned Revelio, Minerva congratulated them and noted the usefulness of the spell.<sup id="cite_ref-HM_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After learning that Bill Weasley had taught Jacob's sibling <i>Incendio</i>, Minerva was furious and scolded him heavily.<sup id="cite_ref-HM_13-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In 1991 friend of <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel" title="Nicolas Flamel">Nicolas Flamel</a>, had the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a> that was keeping him alive moved from his safe in <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts</a> to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> for safe keeping. Minerva contributed to the defences set up around the magical artefact by transfiguring an enormous <a href="/wiki/Chessboard_Chamber" title="Chessboard Chamber">chess set</a> and <a href="/wiki/Piertotum_Locomotor" title="Piertotum Locomotor">animating</a> it to behave as a normal Wizard's chess set would.

This larger than life version of <a href="/wiki/Wizard%27s_Chess" title="Wizard&#39;s Chess">Wizard's chess</a> is known to be brutally violent and sacrificial for wizards to have to take part in themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Also in this year, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, whom Minerva had been watching over for many years, would start his first year of education at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, not knowing this, as he did not know that he was a wizard. Once Harry eventually arrived at Hogwarts, after the delivery of many acceptance letters, Harry was Sorted into the house of <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> which Minerva was head of. Harry was therefore again placed under the watchful eye and care of McGonagall.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Though Minerva often maintained her strict persona in regards to the boy, she wasn't above bending the rules for him on occasion, such as when she caught him flying on a broomstick without proper supervision. Instead of expelling him, which was Madam Hooch's stated punishment for anyone caught doing so, Minerva instead took him to see <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Wood" title="Oliver Wood">Oliver Wood</a>, captain of the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team" title="Gryffindor Quidditch team">Gryffindor Quidditch team</a>, to comment on his prodigious skill with the broom.

She made arrangements for Harry to have a <a href="/wiki/Nimbus_2000" title="Nimbus 2000">Nimbus 2000</a>, the fastest broomstick of the time, for use during games and practices. However, several incidents marred the year.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<p>At Hallowe'en, the festive feast was interrupted by the arrival of Professor Quirrell, who came charging in screaming about a troll loose in the dungeons before fainting dead away. After restoring calm, Dumbledore ordered all students to return to their dormitories while he and the teachers made their way to the dungeons. The troll was not there upon their entry, but a terrible racket from an upper floor provided a clue. Upon reaching the site, Minerva was shocked to discover a wrecked bathroom, an unconscious troll and three bedraggled first years, one of whom was her best student Hermione Granger. To her further shock, Hermione claimed that she had gone looking for the troll thinking she could handle it but would most assuredly have been killed had Harry and Ron not found her. Torn between anger and pride, Minerva took five points from Hermione but awarded five each to Harry and Ron for, as she put it, "sheer dumb luck." Over the Christmas period, she attended the Christmas feast and received a kiss on the cheek from a very drunk Hagrid; rather than admonish him, she instead giggled while blushing red in the face.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<p>However, her serious side appeared one night when she caught Draco Malfoy roaming the school at night. Dragging him by the ear, she sentenced him to detention and deducted twenty points from Slytherin when he claimed that Harry was also out of bed with an illegal baby dragon. Though the dragon in question was successfully released, Harry, Hermione and Neville were all caught and brought before McGonagall by Filch. Mad and disappointed with them, she told them all off before punishing them severely; a loss of fifty points each, 150 in total, and detention with Malfoy. This caused Gryffindor to drop to last in the House Cup.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

Thus, for the first time in years, McGonagall's house was the current house cup champions. Her reaction wasn't documented, but it's assumed that she was pleased with their efforts as Professor Snape shook her hand with a very forced look of congratulations.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

She, along with the rest of the teaching staff, scoured the castle for the Chamber, but to no avail. Minerva was worried over the messages left on the walls and was at a loss about what should be done.

For example when he decorated the Great Hall in nauseatingly lurid pink hearts for Valentine's Day, she was observed to have a muscle twitching noticeably in her face.

<p>When Harry Potter crossed Umbridge, earning a detention in his first class with her, Minerva was sympathetic but warned him that Umbridge was not to be trifled with and that he should keep his head down. McGonagall did all she could to circumvent Umbridge's authority without risking her own security as Deputy Headmistress. Indeed, she treated Umbridge with as little credence and respect as possible while Hogwarts was under investigation by the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> and even gave <a href="/wiki/Peeves" title="Peeves">Peeves</a> tips on how to unscrew a chandelier when he was trying to cause havoc for Umbridge.

<p>Despite Minerva's best efforts to thwart the Ministry's influence at Hogwarts, things continued to grow worse. After Harry's resistance group was discovered by Umbridge, Minerva was present in Dumbledore's office when Harry was brought in. When Umbridge revealed that anti-Muggle prankster <a href="/wiki/Willy_Widdershins" title="Willy Widdershins">Willy Widdershins</a> had provided her with testimony that Harry was forming this rebel group, Minerva loudly voiced that she had wondered why he had managed to avoid prosecution for all his regurgitating toilet charges, joined in her vocal outrage by the portrait of Headmaster <a href="/wiki/Dexter_Fortescue" title="Dexter Fortescue">Dexter Fortescue</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_10-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Dumbledore managed to save Harry by taking credit for the student organisation, which led to Fudge announcing his intention to arrest him and actually attempted to have him taken by force, sneering at the idea of Dumbledore taking on him and the others single-handed. Minerva, loyal to her mentor and friend, loudly declared that he wouldn't be single-handed and actually made to draw her wand, fully prepared to duel the Minister for Magic himself. She only stood down on Dumbledore's direct orders, as Hogwarts would need her.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_10-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After Dumbledore escaped arrest, Umbridge was appointed Headmistress over Minerva, but had virtually no support.

During Harry Potter's session, when Umbridge kept interrupting the conversation and declaring that Harry would never be an <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> at the Ministry, Minerva declared to Harry that she would help him in any way necessary to achieve his goal, even if it was the last thing she ever did.

It was only when she saw Harry Potter's body being carried by Hagrid that she began to despair, letting out a scream terrible to anyone who heard it, equal to that of Ron, Hermione, and Ginny's together. Nonetheless, Minerva continued to fight when the battle resumed after the attack by the <a href="/wiki/Centaur" title="Centaur">Centaurs</a> on Voldemort and the Death Eaters.

Professor McGonagall was also surprised to discover, and took no small amount of pride in, the fact that more than seventy-four percent of the volunteers that had taken time off their busy schedules to assist the Ministry of Magic - by quill and parchment - with the arduous job of tracking, sorting, cataloguing, collating, and archiving returned <a href="/wiki/Foundable" title="Foundable">Foundables</a> for the Ministry were current and former members of <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff House</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-WUBE_Back_to_Hogwarts_18-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WUBE_Back_to_Hogwarts-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> 
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Calamity_Investigator" title="Calamity Investigator">Calamity Investigator</a> was eventually successful in returning the Hogwarts Express in time for the start of the term, much to the relief of Minerva; who pointed out that the time-honoured tradition of riding the train to school was as much part of the "Hogwarts experience" as the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_ceremony" title="Sorting ceremony">Sorting ceremony</a>. She was also relieved to hear of the safe return of the <a href="/wiki/Trolley_witch" title="Trolley witch">Trolley witch</a>, who had been turned into a <a href="/wiki/Foundable" title="Foundable">Foundable</a> and at some point afterwards retrieved by the aforementioned Task Force member, saying that the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a> would not be the same without her and her sweets, noting that she could remember her working at the train even back when Minerva herself was a student, during which she was "partial" to her <a href="/wiki/Pumpkin_Pasty" title="Pumpkin Pasty">Pumpkin Pasties</a>. That was not to say that her troubles was over, however, as The Calamity hit the school itself next, spiriting off with the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, one of the <a href="/wiki/Thestral" title="Thestral">Thestrals</a> in Hogwart's <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Thestral_herd" title="Hogwarts Thestral herd">herd</a>, one of their <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_carriages" class="mw-redirect" title="Hogwarts carriages">carriages</a>, one of their <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_boats" title="Hogwarts boats">boats</a>, a Winged Boar Statue and even the sign directing people between <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Castle" title="Hogwarts Castle">Hogwarts Castle</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade Village</a>; all of which the same diligent individual was able to retrieve and return to their allotted places, much to the delight of the denizens of Hogwarts Castle.

The next items on the list included a school crest and her <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Merlin" title="Order of Merlin">Order of Merlin</a>, First Class, which she had framed and kept in her office, and an old photo of <a href="/wiki/Dougal_McGregor" title="Dougal McGregor">Dougal McGregor</a>, about whom she refused to comment when Pickering questioned the man's identity, saying only that he was "<i>a man [she} once knew</i>" and that that was all she was prepared to say on the matter.<sup id="cite_ref-WUBE_Lost_Love_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-WUBE_Lost_Love-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>

When Minerva was happy or relaxed, she seemed like a different person entirely. She was capable of blending into <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> crowds though Harry noted that the appearance didn't suit her.
</p><p>Minerva often wore emerald green robes or her favourite tartan pattern.

She also wore a pointed hat cocked to one side.

<p>Minerva almost constantly exuded magnanimity and sternness, being held in great respect (and some fear) by nearly all students and staff. Used to having her way, she tolerated neither audacity nor silliness from her pupils and was known to turn cold towards people who said or did things in front of her that were stupid, or if she thought they were trying to be funny.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF_15-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> She was a woman who rarely smiled or gave compliments freely. Despite her stern demeanour, Minerva did exhibit a dry sense of humour which usually came out when times were tough.

<p>True to Gryffindor, Minerva valued bravery and courage highly, believing cowardice be a heavy flaw. She fought the Death Eaters and protected her students, proving her bravery. Despite her loyalty to her house, Minerva was a fair-minded person who was known for docking points from students in her own House when she saw it must be done.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Although she permitted of-age students to choose whether they wanted  to stay or evacuate for the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> as a respect for their valour and rights, she gave the strict orders for anyone underage to evacuate, prioritising their safety over their courage and refusing to let under-qualified children risk  dying in battle despite their desires.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_8-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>For the most part, though, Minerva usually maintained great emotional composure, without being indifferent. Although she wasn't always particularly personable, she could be very warm and supportive during times of trouble or loss and cared a great deal about her students, both personally and academically. She was known to be extremely caring in times of tragedy, being known for her kindness in her own reserved manner. Though it rarely happened, Minerva showed a temper that could reveal itself on occasions when she was angry or flustered.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF_15-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Apparently, she shared this temper with her father.

<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>As the devoted instructor of <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_(class)" title="Transfiguration (class)">Transfiguration classes</a>, Minerva highly respected this <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">specific branch</a> of magic, which she considered  be among the most difficult and sophisticated magic that Hogwarts students learn.  She become an <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a> - a complicated, long process- to further her study in this subject and enjoyed correcting articles in <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_Today" title="Transfiguration Today">Transfiguration Today</a>.

</p><p>Though she gave up Quidditch on leaving Hogwarts, the innately competitive Minerva later took a keen interest in the fortunes of her house team and retained a keen eye for Quidditch talent. She enjoyed watching <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a>, and supported the <a href="/wiki/Montrose_Magpies" title="Montrose Magpies">Montrose Magpies</a>.
</p><p>Minerva inherited her cast-iron moral sense from her father. As a law-abiding citizen, she respected the particular law that all Animagi of Britain must register, insisting that <a href="/wiki/Talbott_Winger" title="Talbott Winger">Talbott Winger</a> do so despite understanding his reason of secrecy. She wasn't inducted into the Order of the Phoenix during Voldemort’s first climb to power because the Order was held as a renegade outfit by the Ministry, who feared Dumbledore’s charisma and magical talent and were inclined to harbour fears that he wished to succeed them. Instead, she became their informant and bravely spied on Voldemort's followers in the guise of a cat.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_10-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>However, by the time of the second wizarding war, Minerva was no longer prepared to act as a spy for a Ministry she believed had become corrupt and dangerous. She is known to have a very severe dislike and hatred of those who abuse power, such as her making an enemy of <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> for the latter's bigoted and sociopathic behaviour.

<p>Minerva McGonagall was an incredibly powerful and talented <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">witch</a> whom none should have ever underestimated. Her magical prowess allowed her to be the teacher of <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_(class)" title="Transfiguration (class)">Transfiguration</a>, a remarkably complex field of magic which she proved to be an expert in. She was also highly capable in many areas of magic as well as Transfiguration, the proof of this being she survived both Wizarding Wars and a duel with Voldemort himself, as well as correctly brewing the extremely advanced Animagus potion at only seventeen years of age. She was also the only person ever seen to produce three Patronus charms at once, which she additionally did non-verbally. Many wizards and witches alike are unable to produce one Patronus whilst saying the incantation, so this is further evidence of Minerva's world class ability.

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">Magical</a> mastery</b>: Minerva was an exceptionally powerful and talented witch, having inherited such talent from her mother and great-grandmother. She achieved top grades in her <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_Wizarding_Level" title="Ordinary Wizarding Level">O.W.Ls</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nastily_Exhausting_Wizarding_Test" title="Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test">N.E.W.Ts</a> when she was at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_school_of_witchcraft_and_wizardry" class="mw-redirect" title="Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, being quickly recognised as the most outstanding student of her year, with a particular talent for <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a>. During her school years, she was the recipient of several awards such as the "<i>Transfiguration Today</i> Most Promising Newcomer Award". As an adult, Minerva displayed her tremendous skills and powers by successfully becoming the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Transfiguration" title="Head of Transfiguration">Head of Transfiguration</a>, Deputy Headmistress, and Headmistress at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with surviving both Wizarding Wars and even going on to challenge Voldemort himself along with Horace Slughorn and Kingsley Shacklebolt at the very end of the second wizarding war.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Wandless_magic" title="Wandless magic">Wandless</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nonverbal_spell" title="Nonverbal spell">nonverbal magic</a></b>: Minerva was shown to be extremely skilful at non-verbal magic for a wide variety of spells, especially transfiguration spells and charms which she could perform with just a wave of her wand. This is a testament to her formidable magical skills as both these branches of magic are difficult to begin with not to mention to do them non verbally which requires intense concentration and focus. She could even perform certain spells intentionally without her wand, such as the <a href="/wiki/Avifors_spell" class="mw-redirect" title="Avifors spell">Avifors spell</a> and often wandlessly conjured a textbook into her hands during Transfiguration class.<sup id="cite_ref-HM_13-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> She stalemated and gained the upper hand over Severus Snape in a fierce duel without uttering a single incantation which is further evidence of her extraordinary skills - lesser witches and wizards seemed to produce weaker magic when using non-verbal spells or under the influence of Silencing Charms, but she seemed unhindered. She was fully capable of disintegrating Snape's fiery serpent he sent at her with just a wave of her wand and instantly turning it into swarm of daggers without saying the incantation. They were so powerful even without the incantation that he was forced to hide behind a suit of armour. She non-verbally untransfigured Draco Malfoy when he was turned into a ferret by simply pointing her wand at him.  When Neville Longbottom vanished one of the legs of his desk by accident during a lesson, she had it back very shortly after with just a wave of her wand. She also non-verbally <a href="/wiki/Silver_rope_conjuring_spell" title="Silver rope conjuring spell">conjured a length of shimmering silver rope</a> to hang the Carrow siblings before the Battle of Hogwarts to incapacitate them.<sup id="cite_ref-DH30_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH30-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>

With aid from Pomona Sprout and Filius Flitwick, she swiftly forced Snape to flee from the school by jumping out of a classroom window and flying through the grounds.

<li><b>Indomitable willpower</b>: Minerva, true to being a <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, had an extremely strong willpower and moral compass. She was able to muster the strength to refuse to marry <a href="/wiki/Dougal_McGregor" title="Dougal McGregor">McGregor</a>, whom she was very much in love with, to avoid having to stop using magic, and after the death of her husband <a href="/wiki/Elphinstone_Urquart" title="Elphinstone Urquart">Elphinstone</a>, Minerva remained dedicated to serving <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a> <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a>, her strong will masking the grief and suffering she felt from all except <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>. Indeed, she was held in high regard by the many denizens of Hogwarts during her time as a teacher there, due to how strict, firm and uncompromising she was when dealing with others, which made her one of the most respected (and to some degree feared) <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professors</a> in Hogwarts.

During both <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_Wars" title="Wizarding Wars">Wizarding Wars</a>, Minerva remained staunch in opposing <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> even if she did fear speaking his name, which she soon overcame, despite the losses of many of her friends and even when all hope seemed lost with Dumbledore dying and <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> taking over, Minerva continued to oppose Voldemort and help protect the students from <a href="/wiki/Alecto_and_Amycus_Carrow" title="Alecto and Amycus Carrow">the Carrows</a>. She defiantly led the defenders during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> and even faced Voldemort himself despite <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry</a>'s apparent death seemingly rendering the Dark Lord unbeatable. Minerva's moral compass also remained steadfast even in the face of great victories as she did not hesitate to take 150 <a href="/wiki/House_points" title="House points">House points</a> from Gryffindor to punish Harry, <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> and <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville</a> despite how close Gryffindor was to winning the <a href="/wiki/House_Cup" title="House Cup">House Cup</a> and she remained adamant in confiscating Harry's <a href="/wiki/Firebolt" title="Firebolt">Firebolt</a> even though it would greatly benefit the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team" title="Gryffindor Quidditch team">Gryffindor Quidditch team</a>.</li>

<p>Minerva showed her care for Harry ever since she, Dumbledore and Hagrid left him in the care of the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursleys</a>, in part because she had been quite fond of Harry's late parents. She was sort of a loving grandmother to him and expressed concern with both Dumbledore's choice trusting Hagrid to safely transport Harry to <a href="/wiki/Little_Whinging" title="Little Whinging">Little Whinging</a>, and of the choice of family with whom Harry would stay. She spent hours on end spying on the Dursleys to get an insight to what life for Harry growing up would be like,<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> calling them "the worst sort of Muggles imaginable".<sup id="cite_ref-PSF_40-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PSF-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup>  It is unlikely, however, that she kept watch over Harry, as she would never go against Dumbledore's actions, no matter how much she disagreed with them.
</p><p>When Harry arrived at Hogwarts, Minerva was naturally pleased that he was sorted into Gryffindor, her house and as he studied in Hogwarts. Although her relationship with him remained mostly normal, she kept a watchful eye on him and his friends <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ronald Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> to ensure his safety. She also (along with the other professors) reported that he was likeable, humble and talented.<sup id="cite_ref-DH33_43-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH33-43">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup> Although she was fully willing to punish him for his misdeeds, Minerva would not hesitate to intervene in their affairs whenever necessary to keep them safe and ensured that Harry would not be punished too severely. This was shown when Harry and his friends were caught sneaking around the tower in the dead of night during their first year at Hogwarts and she sent him off to serve detention in the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>.
</p><p>
However, rather than punishing or expelling him for having broken Madam Hooch's order that no student would ride on their broomsticks and the risk he took, Minerva brought him to see <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Wood" title="Oliver Wood">Oliver Wood</a>, captain of the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team" title="Gryffindor Quidditch team">Gryffindor Quidditch team</a>, announcing that she had found their new <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">Seeker</a>. In her gratitude for Harry accepting the position, she bought him a <a href="/wiki/Nimbus_2000" title="Nimbus 2000">Nimbus 2000</a> for his first Quidditch game.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> Her affection for him even allowed her to forgive him and Ron's use of the Weasleys's flying car to reach Hogwarts, which risked exposure of the wizarding world and broke several of the international laws, a far more serious deed than smuggling Norbert out of Hogwarts, without even taking House Points from Gryffindor and only punishing him and Ron by giving them both detention. She nearly smiled when Harry pointed out how she couldn't take House Points for Gryffindor as it was only the beginning of the year.</p><figure class="thumb tleft show-info-icon" style="width: 237px"> 	<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/9/96/McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png/revision/latest?cb=20151216143647" class="image"><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" width="235" height="152" class="thumbimage lazyload" data-image-name="McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png" data-image-key="McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/9/96/McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/235?cb=20151216143647" /></a> 	<noscript><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/9/96/McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png/revision/latest?cb=20151216143647" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/9/96/McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/235?cb=20151216143647" decoding="async" width="235" height="152" class="thumbimage" data-image-name="McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png" data-image-key="McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/9/96/McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/235?cb=20151216143647" /></a></noscript> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> 		 			<a href="/wiki/File:McGonagallWithHandOnHarrysShoulder.png" class="info-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> 		 		 		 			<p class="caption">McGonagall comforting Harry after refusing to allow him to go to Hogsmeade</p> 		 	</figcaption> </figure><p> This particularly strong concern for Harry, clearly above what Minerva felt for most other individual students, was later shown in his third year: She proved she cared far more for Harry than winning the Quidditch Cup for Gryffindor, ensuring he was kept in maximum security and limiting his time to practise and even not hesitating to confiscate the <a href="/wiki/Firebolt" title="Firebolt">Firebolt</a> he was given to out of concern it was sent by <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> and instantly lost her temper when <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Wood" title="Oliver Wood">Oliver Wood</a> suggested Harry be allowed to fall off his broom as long as he caught the Snitch, intimidating Wood into submission. She also pitied him for being unable to go to <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> due to not having a signed note and appeared to indicate she would be willing to allow him to go had it not been for the danger of Sirius.
</p><p>When Harry became the fourth Triwizard Champion, Minerva adamantly defended Harry from the accusation of <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Olympe Maxime</a> that Harry had been willing to die for the gold rewarded and even went as far as to try to convince Albus into not letting Harry compete, being utterly mortified by the fact that Snape and Dumbledore were willing to use Harry as a bait and often showed herself to be more protective of Harry than the then Headmaster. She also wanted to keep Harry out of the explanation the imposter was about to give, believing Harry had had enough, but reluctantly conceded to Dumbledore's wish that Harry stay. However, she was quick to praise his performance and assure he was tended to in the First Task and helped him train for the Third Task by lending her room.
</p><p>In Harry's fifth year, Minerva promised Harry that she would do whatever she possibly could to see that he achieved his dream of becoming an <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a>. She supported him unequivocally even though she had never been fully in his confidence. When she later found out about the sort of <a href="/wiki/Black_Quill" title="Black Quill">punishment</a> Harry and various other students had been receiving from <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, Minerva expressed nothing but absolute disgust and disapproval, despite the power Umbridge wielded.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_10-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> In return, although Harry disliked her strictness regarding his opposition of Umbridge, he was still grateful for her care towards him and was utterly infuriated when McGonagall was attacked so severely by the Aurors sent to capture Hagrid she had to be sent to St Mungo to the point where he even believed Umbridge being murdered brutally (fed to a <a href="/wiki/Blast-Ended_Skrewt" title="Blast-Ended Skrewt">Blast-Ended Skrewt</a>) was not a punishment good enough and immediately felt such anger that he coldly defied Umbridge when she gloated over McGonagall's current state despite being cornered.

<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>Shortly prior to the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Amycus Carrow - who, along with his sister <a href="/wiki/Alecto_Carrow" title="Alecto Carrow">Alecto</a>, had been posted at the school by Voldemort - demanded to know where Harry was in the Tower and McGonagall asked why he would be there as he belonged in her house, with clear pride in her voice. When Amycus spat at McGonagall, Harry was outraged to the point of attacking him with the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a>, even agreeing with <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>'s assertion that one had to "really mean it" to perform the curse correctly. Although shocked by Harry's sudden appearance and his use of an <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curse</a>, she was clearly touched by the gesture. Though Minerva initially tried to convince Harry to flee out of concern for his safety, she immediately joined Harry in retaking the castle and preparing for battle. She did this when he informed her that he was acting on Dumbledore's orders. Nearing the end of the Battle of Hogwarts, Minerva's devastation was great when she saw <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> carrying Harry's seemingly dead body. This grief was enough to make her duel Voldemort head on in the final battle, alongside <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a>, in order to protect the rest of her students.

</p><p>The two continued to have a very positive relationship over the following years. Harry acted as a frequent guest lecturer on Defence Against The Dark Arts, under Minerva's jurisdiction. She would serve as Headmistress over Harry's three children, and in turn she learned to expect them to get into the same kinds of trouble as their father. This was to be expected, after having now taught and served over three generations of Potters. Minerva's relationship with Harry experienced a brief strain when he blackmailed her into using the Marauder's Map to ensure Albus and Scorpius remains apart, which she felt great discontent at doing, but it was reconciled when Harry apologised and she wasn't shown to hold any ill-will afterwards.

<p>Minerva took a shine to Hermione Granger since the younger witch successfully transfigured a match into a needle early on in her first Transfiguration lesson, before any other student. She gave Hermione one of her "rare smiles". Hence, Minerva was extremely shocked and disappointed in Hermione when she said she had gone looking for the <a href="/wiki/Troll" title="Troll">Troll</a> that invaded <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, under the impression that she could stop it. The claim wasn't true, but Minerva was none the wiser.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_3-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> When Hermione was attacked by the <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Basilisk" class="mw-redirect" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Basilisk">Basilisk</a> in 1992, Minerva was greatly moved and would often take time to visit her Petrified student in the hospital wing.<sup id="cite_ref-COS_14-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In Hermione's third year, Minerva went to the effort to arrange for Hermione to be given permission to use a <a href="/wiki/Time-Turner" title="Time-Turner">Time-Turner</a> to take additional classes. Teachers didn't often seek permission for a student to use one of the devices, but she saw something special in Hermione and went out of her way to make sure the younger witch wasn't under-achieving.<sup id="cite_ref-POA_6-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Hermione further showed her high regard of Hermione, by appointing her a Gryffindor <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">prefect</a> in her fifth year at Hogwarts. When Minerva was attacked by several Ministry employees outside of Hagrid's Hut, Hermione showed deep emotion towards the event, like Minerva did a few years before. She and McGonagall were allies during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">Battle of the Astronomy Tower</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, surviving the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>.
</p><p>Minerva was a role model for Hermione and both had much in common. They both believed that <a href="/wiki/Divination" title="Divination">Divination</a> was a very "woolly" subject and that <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney" title="Sybill Trelawney">Professor Trelawney</a> was a fraud,<sup id="cite_ref-POA_6-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> Furthermore, both were considered for Ravenclaw, but in the end were both Sorted into Gryffindor House.

<p>While <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Professor Snape</a> favoured students of his own house and often overlooked any misbehaviour from students like Draco Malfoy, McGonagall had little tolerance for nonsense from any student, regardless of their house, and took no notice of the Malfoy family's status within the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding community</a>. As she wasn't a Slytherin, Malfoy didn't respect her at all but was never foolish enough to make this clear in front of her. 
</p><p>Despite her clear disapproval of Malfoy's pure-blood supremacist leanings, McGonagall sought to protect him as much as every other student, being completely appalled when <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a> (<a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">Barty Crouch Jnr</a> in disguise) <a href="/wiki/Human_to_ferret_spell" title="Human to ferret spell">transformed</a> Draco into a ferret in 1994. She transformed Malfoy back into his human form and reminded Moody that they never use transfiguration as a punishment. In addition, Minerva wouldn't accept Harry's accusations of Malfoy mailing a <a href="/wiki/Opal_Necklace" title="Opal Necklace">cursed necklace</a> without sufficient evidence, nor condone any attacks Harry made on Malfoy such as when the former used the <a href="/wiki/Sectumsempra" title="Sectumsempra">Sectumsempra</a> curse (not knowing exactly what it did) on Malfoy, in 1997.
</p><p>However, when Draco was proven to have led a group of Death Eaters into the castle, Minerva came to see him as much an enemy as any Death Eater, until after the war, where Draco was pardoned. At which point. Minerva and Draco established a cordial relationship, as she accepted Draco's <a href="/wiki/Scorpius_Malfoy" title="Scorpius Malfoy">son</a> into Hogwarts and treated him just as she would every student despite whatever dark feelings she may had towards Draco for his misdeeds, being utterly appealed at Harry's request that she help Albus and Scorpius stay apart. Draco also trusted her into using the Marauder's Map to find his son and Albus and fully accepted whatever punishment would be given to Scorpius, acknowledging he believed her decision would be fair.

<p>Minerva liked James Potter (an intelligent and talented wizard), despite the fact that he could sometimes be a bit of a bully and was not above bending the rules.

McGonagall was devastated at the murder in 1981 of Lily and James, both of whom she considered her all-time favourites. She later became friendly with the Potters' son, Harry, who was also her student and a member of her House, though she did not show favouritism and was more than willing to take many points even from her own House for misbehaviour.
</p><p>A little over a decade after he left Hogwarts, Remus Lupin (a former <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">Prefect</a> of her House) returned to the school in order to teach <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a>, becoming Minerva's professional colleaguein 1993. She didn't care about the fact Remus was a werewolf, because Dumbledore trusted him, and respected his efficient teaching skills, as she referenced him during Harry's <a href="/wiki/Careers_Advice" title="Careers Advice">Careers Advice</a>. The two  were members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>. After Dumbledore's death, McGonagall, Lupin and several other individuals were devastated; they all discussed about the way Snape killed Dumbledore. Sadly, Lupin himself died in the Battle of Hogwarts.
</p><p>Minerva had a good relationship with Sirius Black. But after James' death, she, the rest of the wizarding community, assumed it was Sirius who betrayed the Potters since he was expected to be their <a href="/wiki/Secret-Keeper" class="mw-redirect" title="Secret-Keeper">Secret-Keeper</a>. Only in 1995 did she learn that the Secret-Keeper at the time of the Potters' deaths was actually Peter Pettigrew, who took the title after Sirius turned it down.

<p>Rubeus Hagrid respected McGonagall.

McGonagall was one of the most serious professors at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, and sometimes disapproved of Hagrid's behaviour, especially during the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_ceremony" title="Sorting ceremony">Sorting ceremony</a>.

<p>Minerva McGonagall was Severus Snape's professor of Transfiguration during his time as a student at Hogwarts. After he had graduated and then returned as the <a href="/wiki/Potion" title="Potion">Potions</a> master, he and McGonagall became colleagues. As Head of <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor House</a>, McGonagall and Snape teased one another about House points and Quidditch standings, acting like friendly rivals to one another. Like Snape, McGonagall was a strict disciplinarian, but was fairer to <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, who was a member of her House. 
</p><p>Both were demanding and effective teachers, unusually talented at magic, and loyal to Albus Dumbledore, so over time, Minerva grew to respect Severus despite his dark past. McGonagall knew that Snape was a Death Eater in his youth, but she followed <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> in believing that he truly regretted his former allegiance. She did, however, admit to being suspicious of Snape's true allegiance though she trusted him simply because Albus did. Unusually for Snape, he was on first name terms with McGonagall, showing a certain level of personal friendship.

<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>After Snape killed Dumbledore, McGonagall was shocked and perhaps personally hurt to find her formerly-respected colleague a murderer and apparent traitor. When Snape became Headmaster of Hogwarts, she opposed him and his supposed minions the Carrows, without knowing Snape was secretly helping her protect the students from his fellow <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. At the onset of the Battle of Hogwarts, McGonagall and Snape duelled inconclusively; with <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Professor Flitwick</a>'s later help, and Snape fled the school rather than continue the fight. McGonagall, believing his retreat was motivated by fear, called out "Coward!", an insult he particularly detested. Snape was killed by Voldemort during the battle, but she learnt that Snape had killed Dumbledore in a painful act of loyalty to the Headmaster's own orders too late. Following a private conversation with Harry, Minerva later took the controversial decision to add a portrait of Severus Snape to the gallery of old headmasters and headmistresses in her tower office. There is no report that she objected this, which shows that she likely forgave him and came to admire his marvellous bravery.

This was due to him being obnoxious, incompetent and insensitive, annoying her with nonsensical advices while being ignorant and unhelpful around the second opening of the Chamber of Secrets.

Minerva was positively hateful towards Lockhart when he walked in late and oblivious when everyone else was greatly saddened at <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley's</a> impending doom. She full-heartedly supported Snape sending Lockhart to deal with the monster within in the hopes of scaring her incompetent colleague away.

<p>Having taught <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> during his time at Hogwarts, Minerva had her suspicions about him and shared them with Dumbledore, who also was cautious about the younger wizard. During the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>, Minerva joined the fight against Voldemort and his <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, using her skill as an Animagi to spy on the Dark Lord's followers and report her findings to the <a href="/wiki/Auror_Office" title="Auror Office">Auror Office</a>. 
</p><p>During his second rise to power, Minerva joined the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> and stayed in Hogwarts during the tenure of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> as <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">Headmaster</a> and the Carrows to protect her students. She is one of the few people that isn't afraid of standing against the Carrows, as she did defy them many times during the 1997-1998 school year. In spite of her well-known loyalty to Professor Dumbledore, Voldemort and his followers believed that Minerva was both too gifted to lose, and too sensible not to join them fully once their victory was assured. However, she proved him wrong when she defended the school against his army and, along with <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a>, bravely duelled Voldemort himself during the second part of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>. She watched as Voldemort is defeated by <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> once and for all finally ending the War. 
</p><p>Like most in the Wizarding world, Minerva was initially wary of speaking Voldemort's name. Noticeably, however, she became unafraid of saying Voldemort's name sometime during the second wizarding war, as she told <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Filius Flitwick</a> before the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> to not to be afraid of it because Voldemort would try to kill him anyway (though in the book she still referred to him as He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named).

<p>Minerva disliked Dolores Umbridge right from the beginning when the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher began to invade Hogwarts with her <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_High_Inquisitor" title="Hogwarts High Inquisitor">Hogwarts High Inquisitor</a> position and did everything she could in her power to circumvent Umbridge's authority without risking the loss of her job. She was the colleague whom she had more violently clashed with than any other colleague in her long and varied career. During Umbridge's inspections of McGonagall's class, Minerva tried for the most part to ignore Umbridge. This was difficult due to Umbridge's constant interruptions by means Umbridge's soft, girlish cough of "<i>Hem hem</i>". When forced to acknowledge Umbridge's presence, McGonagall treated her with a cold and harsh demeanour.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_10-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Despite Umbridge having the power to put Minerva on probation or even sack her, Minerva was not afraid to show her disgust and hatred of Umbridge to the woman's face. Despite this, she understood that Umbridge had a lot of power and that she was reporting directly to <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>, and so Minerva once warned <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> to tread carefully around Umbridge. Even so, Minerva vehemently vouched for Harry during their <a href="/wiki/Careers_Advice" title="Careers Advice">Career Advice</a> session, claiming that she would coach him nightly if she had to in order to realise his dream of becoming an <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a>, after Umbridge's furious protests that Harry would never become one. After Umbridge fired <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney" title="Sybill Trelawney">Sybill Trelawney</a> from her post as <a href="/wiki/Divination" title="Divination">Divination</a> teacher, Minerva even put aside her mild dislike of Sybill to focus even more on her hatred of Umbridge, indirectly stating that the latter's evaluation is incompetent and will not be taken into consideration.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_10-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Even when Dolores took over Hogwarts, replacing <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> as Head of the school, Minerva continued to help undermine Umbridge's reign, preferring to watch her struggle with the chaos that was being caused by the students and <a href="/wiki/Peeves" title="Peeves">Peeves</a> (and sometimes even helping with it). When Minerva was attacked and sent to <a href="/wiki/St_Mungo%27s" class="mw-redirect" title="St Mungo&#39;s">St Mungo's</a>, Dolores was pleased that she at last had complete control of Hogwarts. After she returned to Hogwarts, Minerva did nothing to curb the students' enthusiasm when Peeves chased Dolores from Hogwarts, only lamenting that she could not watch with them because the poltergeist had taken her walking stick to hit Dolores with as he followed her from the school.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_10-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Umbridge returned to the Ministry in a high-ranking position and interrogated Muggle-borns, capturing them and imprisoning them to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>. However, after the Second Wizarding War, Umbridge was captured by Aurors and sent to Azkaban herself, for the rest of her life.
</p><p>Despite their hatred for each other, both McGonagall and Umbridge share the same <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">patronus</a>: a cat, although McGonagall's resembled her Animagus form.

<ul><li>McGonagall's <a href="/wiki/Tabby_Cat" class="mw-redirect" title="Tabby Cat">Tabby Cat</a> <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a> appearance is portrayed in the first instalment by <a href="/wiki/Mrs_P._Head" class="mw-redirect" title="Mrs P. Head">Mrs P. Head</a>.</li>
<li>A younger Minerva McGonagall is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Fiona_Glascott" title="Fiona Glascott">Fiona Glascott</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald" title="Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a></i>.
<ul><li>Previously, on <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_Wiki" title="Harry Potter Wiki">Harry Potter Wiki</a> and <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_Lexicon" title="Harry Potter Lexicon">Harry Potter Lexicon</a>, McGonagall's year of birth was calculated to be 1935 from her  <i><a href="/wiki/Pottermore" title="Pottermore">Pottermore</a></i> biography and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, Chapter 15 (<i>The Hogwarts High Inquisitor</i>), which reveals she began Hogwarts in December 1956 after working for the Ministry for two years immediately after graduation. This places her graduation in 1954, her first year in 1947, and her birth in 1935, because of her October birthday, she was almost 12 when starting at Hogwarts. Furthermore, her <i><a href="/wiki/Pottermore" title="Pottermore">Pottermore</a></i> piece states that she was a student of Dumbledore when he taught Transfiguration ("under the guidance of her inspirational Transfiguration teacher, Albus Dumbledore. It also states that Dumbledore employed her when he was still Head of the Transfiguration department and that she worked under him when he was Head of the department ("offering her a job in the Transfiguration department, under Head of Department, Albus Dumbledore").
<ul><li>However, in <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald" title="Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a></i>, Albus and Minerva were presented as basically being a contemporary and Dumbledore taught Defence Against the Dark Arts first, meaning he couldn't have taught her Transfiguration. Hence, McGonagall's appearance in <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald" title="Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a></i> greatly upset certain fans and generated debates on the matter. In order to force it to work, she (and Dumbledore) have to switch back and forth implausibly in too short of a timeframe in their career, and it extensively ages <a href="/wiki/Pomona_Sprout" title="Pomona Sprout">Pomona Sprout</a> (who had two overlapping school years with McGonagall) too. Theories have included:
<ul><li>McGonagall's comments to <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, where she says she had been working at the school for "thirty-nine years" never specified that she taught those thirty-nine years <i>consecutively</i>, which was the assumption for the calculation to work. This could mean Minerva had been teaching as Head of the <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_(class)" title="Transfiguration (class)">Transfiguration</a> Department for 39 years and not Hogwarts in general. In this case, it only contradicts Minerva's second statement that she had started as transfiguration professor "after working for the Ministry for two years immediately after graduation."<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_10-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
<ul><li>It is also possible that she took a break in her career at some point in her life like <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> or she was in fact outright lying to Dolores Umbridge about her real length of employment at Hogwarts.</li></ul></li>
<li>There is also the possibility that there was another, older Scottish witch of the same name who also taught at Hogwarts before the birth of the Minerva who appears in the Harry Potter books and films, although it would be unlikely that the two are related as the latter inherited her surname from her Muggle father.<sup id="cite_ref-shortstories_11-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-shortstories-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Another possible theory is the idea of <a href="/wiki/Time-Turner" title="Time-Turner">time travel</a> as this concept has been explored in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child" title="Harry Potter and the Cursed Child">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a></i>, where <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus Severus Potter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Scorpius_Malfoy" title="Scorpius Malfoy">Scorpius Malfoy</a> get stranded in the <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a> timeline but were successfully able to summon their parents back from the <a href="/wiki/2020" title="2020">present</a> to save them. Similarly, there is a possibility that McGonagall travelled back to the early 1910s to fill in <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s previous (or intended) position in <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a>, so Dumbledore could instead teach <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> thus better preparing his students for the <a href="/wiki/Global_wizarding_war" title="Global wizarding war">war</a> to come. If so, it is likely that Dumbledore was able to summon a professor back from the future (which happened to be McGonagall) to fill in the post by sending a out message to her future self in a <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_blanket" title="Harry Potter&#39;s blanket">similar manner</a> like what was used by Albus Severus to summon <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry</a>. Also, in <i>the Cursed Child</i>, she later expresses her disgust about time turners and their consequences towards Albus Severus and Scorpius due to their reckless use of one and towards <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> due to not destroying that. This may also be attributed to a bad experience she had back in those days when using it.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> stated that she always pictured <a href="/wiki/Maggie_Smith" title="Maggie Smith">Maggie Smith</a>, who portrays her in the films, as Professor McGonagall.</li>
<li>Professor McGonagall has the distinction of being the first magical character introduced in the series, when <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon Dursley</a> sees her reading a map in her Animagus form on the morning after the Potters' deaths. Only the three Dursleys are introduced before her. However in the films, McGonagall is the second magical character introduced as <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> appears before her. She is the second overall character introduced in the film series, as well as the first female character introduced.</li>
<li>In the films, McGonagall appears to be older than she is described in the books. The timeline suggests that the character was forty-six when she and Dumbledore left Harry with the Dursleys, was fifty-five when Harry started Hogwarts, and sixty-two by the Battle of Hogwarts. By contrast, Maggie Smith was already in her late sixties at the time that she first played McGonagall.</li>
<li>In the film adaptations, it seems to be a recurring gag to have Minerva delivering alliterative lines; for instance, in <i>Goblet of Fire</i>, she says "behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons", and in <i>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</i>, she says "particular proclivity for pyrotechnics".</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i> there is a painting of a young Minerva McGonagall on the Gryffindor common room wall. The same painting, although in a different frame, can be seen hung at the Grand Staircase interacting with <a href="/wiki/Cadogan" title="Cadogan">Sir Cadogan</a>.</li>
<li>In the film adaptation of <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)"><i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i></a>, she led the respectful wand raising to rid the sky of the dark mark from the late Dumbledore's body.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i>, after casting <i><a href="/wiki/Piertotum_Locomotor" title="Piertotum Locomotor">Piertotum Locomotor</a></i>, Minerva excitedly says to Molly Weasley, "<i>I've always wanted to use that spell!</i>"</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i>, before the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, she tells <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Filius Flitwick</a> not be afraid to say <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a>'s name, because he will try to kill him either way. Also before the Battle of Hogwarts, she duels Snape with what appears to be the <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">Blasting Curse</a>, defeating Amycus and Alecto Carrow before Snape Disapparates.</li>
<li>Minerva is partly inspired by <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>'s inspirational English teacher Lucy Shepherd, who taught her what a good book looks like.</li>
<li>In an early draft of the first book, she was called "Madam McGonagle".</li>
<li>Minerva was the first Animagus introduced in canon.</li>
<li>She was the first female character confirmed to have kept her maiden when she married. Later, it was revealed that Hermione Granger also did.</li>
<li>In an interview after the publication of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K.

<li>Minerva McGonagall and <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> share the same <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Cat" title="Cat">cat</a>.</li>

<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_1-4" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</a></i>, Professor McGonagall can't enter the Gryffindor Common Room despite the fact she is the head of the house and she was in Gryffindor House while student at Hogwarts.</li>
