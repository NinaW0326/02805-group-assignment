After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. In turn, this caused the <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">Potter family</a> to go into hiding. Voldemort made his first <a href="/wiki/Attack_at_Godric%27s_Hollow_(1981)" title="Attack at Godric&#39;s Hollow (1981)">vain attempt</a> to circumvent the prophecy when Harry was a year and three months old. During this attempt, he murdered Harry's parents as they tried to protect him, but this unsuccessful attempt to kill Harry led to Voldemort's first downfall.

This event made Harry the only person to have survived the Killing Curse, thus giving him the title the "Boy Who Lived".

The scar would be a bane and also a blessing to Harry in the years to come, as it opened a telepathic link between Lord Voldemort and himself, giving each some awareness of each other's thoughts.

The <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursleys</a> proudly considered themselves a "normal" family and despised anything out of the ordinary. They lied to Harry about his parents' death, claiming they had died in a car crash.

</p><p>They resented Harry for his <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a>, which was sporadic, but evident and strongly discouraged any sort of imagination. They neglected Harry, verbally and emotionally abused him, and inflicted cruel punishments like depriving him of meals and locking him into the cupboard under the stairs on him whenever something "unusual" occurred. Their behaviour was left unreported to authorities. In his youth, Harry could make strange things happen without understanding why he could, as no one had told him that he was a <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a>.

<p>Harry's hardship, however, was highly necessary as by returning to live with his mother's only living blood relative, the protection that Lily gave Harry would continue.

<p>Harry had no birthday celebrations until the day he turned 11, which was the same day that he discovered the exceptional reality about <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">his identity</a>.

When the Dursleys saw the first letter was addressed as "<i>cupboard under the stairs</i>", they panicked at the thought of Harry's ill treatment being observed and transferred him to Dudley's second bedroom out of fear of being arrested for child abuse, which soon appeared on letters as the <a href="/wiki/The_Smallest_Bedroom" class="mw-redirect" title="The Smallest Bedroom"><i>smallest bedroom.</i></a>
</p><p>When <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Uncle Vernon</a> first read the letter, he turned a pale porridge grey out of fear that wizards were trying to contact Harry. Because of this, Vernon tried to destroy the letters in a futile attempt to keep Harry from his destiny. But the letters kept coming in increasingly larger quantities, to the point where they started flying out of the fireplace by the dozens, and as they did, the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursleys</a> saw no alternative, but to flee from them. This was not enough to let the Dursleys avoid the letters, as the owls carrying these letters followed them wherever they went.

The family then drove off leaving Harry at the busy station all alone. With only ten minutes left until the train's departure at eleven a.m., Harry was panicking when he overheard a red-headed family complaining about the station being packed with Muggles and he noticed they had an owl with their belongings.

<p>Harry watched as the older boys magically passed through the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Harry nervously interrupted them and was introduced to the youngest son <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, who was starting his first year as well.

After boarding, the train soon departed and Ron asked if he could sit with Harry, who agreed.

Malfoy had been bragging about his skill to anyone who would listen. <a href="/wiki/Rolanda_Hooch" title="Rolanda Hooch">Madam Rolanda Hooch</a> taught the class by starting with basic broom control. After learning the theory, the students were told to hover gently off the ground on Madam Hooch's go-ahead.

Madam Hooch took Neville to the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Wing" title="Hospital Wing">Hospital Wing</a> after warning the other students to stay on the ground until she got back.

Harry mounted his broom and kicked off after him. As much to his surprise as everyone else's, he discovered that he could not only fly, but that it was something he didn't need to be taught. Bending low on the broom handle, he shot toward Draco, who realised that Harry was a better flyer and threw the Remembrall into the air, daring the famous boy to catch it. Harry raced the ball towards the ground, catching it and coming out of his dive a foot from the ground. He toppled lightly onto the grass amidst the cheers of the Gryffindors, grinning wildly.

<p><a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> noticed their guilty faces, and looking for a reason to punish them, confiscated Harry’s book on the feeble pretext that library books were not be taken outside. Harry noticed that Snape was limping, as though his leg was injured, strengthening his suspicions that the <a href="/wiki/Potions_Master" title="Potions Master">Potions Master</a> was after whatever it was that Fluffy was guarding. Nervous about the next day's match, Harry decided to ask Snape for the book back; realising that he would most likely be in the <a href="/wiki/Staffroom" title="Staffroom">staffroom</a> and that it would be harder for Snape to bully him if there were other teachers around, Harry decided to confront him. Approaching the door, Harry overheard Snape complaining to <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch">Filch</a> about Fluffy. After opening the door Harry saw Filch helping Snape to bandage his leg. He returned to the Common Room and then told his two friends everything he had seen.

<p>Harry had little time to dwell on Snape’s injury as the first <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> match began the very next morning. Harry's job as being the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team" title="Gryffindor Quidditch team">Gryffindor</a> <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">Seeker</a> was to catch the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Snitch" title="Golden Snitch">Golden Snitch</a>. The snitch is a walnut-sized gold ball, that is extremely fast and difficult to see. The entire match rested upon the retrival of the Snitch. Harry’s first attempt to catch the Snitch was foiled when the <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">Seeker</a> <a href="/wiki/Blatching" title="Blatching">blatched</a> him. Though the Seeker was penalised, the move succeeded in stopping Harry from getting to the Snitch.  
</p><p>Soon after, Harry’s broom began bucking uncontrollably as if trying to unseat him. The bucking became even more violent with each passing second, until Harry was hanging from the broom with just one hand. The crowd looked on with horror, some of the professors had their wands at the ready should he fall. Ron and Hermione began to wonder if the other was at fault. That is until <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a>, who had arrived to watch the game, noted that it would take <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">powerful dark magic</a> to make a <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a> so hard to manage. Magic that powerful is well above the level of a second year and therefore had to be cases by a qualified wizard. This announcement did nothing to help the worried friends.

<p><a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, who had turned her gaze away from Harry, and was scanning the stands, noticed that <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> was staring unblinkingly at Harry and muttering nonstop under his breath. Thinking quickly, Hermione took advantage of the fact that everyone’s attention was now focused on Harry (and the Weasley twins’ attempts to rescue him) to run around the entire <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_pitch" title="Quidditch pitch">stadium</a>, knocking over <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Professor Quirrell</a>, and ending up behind Snape. Muttering a few "well-chosen words" Hermione lit Snape’s robes on fire with <a href="/wiki/Bluebell_Flames" title="Bluebell Flames">Bluebell Flames</a>; a yell of shock told her she had done her job and she scooped the fire into a jar. Suddenly, up in the air, the spell on Harry’s broomstick was broken and he was once again able to control his broom. The spectators watched in confusion as Harry dove towards the ground, only to clasp his hand to his mouth as if he was being violently sick the instant he landed. In actuality Harry had caught the Snitch in his mouth. His capture of the Snitch ended the match, thus Gryffindor won.

<p>On <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> day, Harry and <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> awoke to a pile of presents each at the foot of their beds. At the bottom of the pile, he found a package containing an Invisibility Cloak and an anonymous note telling him only that the cloak once belonged to <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">his father</a>, and to "use it well". That night Harry, thoughts on the Cloak and decided to try it out. Realising he could go anywhere, he snuck back to the library and headed straight for the <a href="/wiki/Restricted_Section" title="Restricted Section">Restricted Section</a>. Knowing he had to start somewhere, Harry pulled down one of the heavier books, and let it fall open on his knee. To his shock and horror, the silence was rent by a blood-curdling scream that issued from the book in front of him. He stuffed the book back in its place and ran for the door, knocking over the lantern he brought with him in his haste. Ducking under <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch">Filch</a>’s outstretched arms, Harry ran down the dark corridors, away from the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Library" title="Hogwarts Library">library</a>, and away from Filch.
</p><p>Thinking he had escaped, Harry was scared to hear Filch’s voice approaching, and horrified when he realised whom Filch was talking to: <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a>. As Snape and Filch rounded the corner, Harry realised that although his father’s cloak made him invisible, it did not stop him from being solid, and that he had no chance of sneaking past them, as the corridor was particularly narrow. Thinking quickly, (and panicking slightly), Harry noticed a door to his left; slipping inside, he found himself in an abandoned classroom. After Filch and Snape passed his hiding place, Harry relaxed and took in more details about the room he was in.

<p>In doing so, he noticed something he had missed the first time: an old, <a href="/wiki/Mirror_of_Erised" title="Mirror of Erised">gilded mirror</a> bearing the inscription “<i>Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi</i>”. Stepping in front of the mirror, Harry very nearly cried out in shock: inside the mirror he saw a large crowd of people standing behind him. Shocked, Harry turned around to look at the room, but saw no one there. Turning back to the mirror and looking more closely, Harry realised that the man and woman in the front looked oddly like him. The man looked just like him, from his untidy hair to his glasses, and the <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">woman</a>, Harry saw, had the same eyes he had. Understanding, Harry focused on other members of the crowd, and saw others who had his untidy hair, his eyes, and even an old man who had Harry’s knees; Harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life.
</p><p>The next night, Harry brought Ron with him to the mirror room. Ron did not see Harry’s family in the mirror, but instead saw himself standing alone, tall, holding the <a href="/wiki/House_Cup" title="House Cup">House Cup</a>, wearing badges indicating he was <a href="/wiki/Head_Boy_or_Girl" title="Head Boy or Girl">Head Boy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_Captain#Hogwarts_Quidditch_Captains" title="Quidditch Captain">Quidditch Captain</a>. The two began arguing over who would be allowed to look in the mirror; <a href="/wiki/Mrs_Norris" title="Mrs Norris">Mrs Norris</a>, Filch’s prowling cat, entered the room, attracted by the sounds of their argument. The next day, Ron, worried about being caught and about his friend’s obsession with the mirror, warned Harry not to return; Harry, however, was not to be dissuaded.

<p>Going to the <a href="/wiki/Disused_classroom" title="Disused classroom">room</a> that evening, Harry was ready to stay there all night, staring at the family he lost. However, in his haste, he failed to notice <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Professor Dumbledore</a> standing by the door until after he removed his cloak. Dumbledore, who had been waiting for Harry, explained that the mirror, which was known as the “Mirror of Erised”, displayed the deepest, most desperate desire of whomever looked into it. Harry, who had never known his family, saw them standing around him; Ron, ever overshadowed by his older brothers, saw himself standing alone, the best of them all.  
</p><p>Before sending Harry back to bed, however, Dumbledore warned him that the mirror was and a dangerous object; men had been driven mad by what they saw in the mirror, not knowing if what they saw was real, or even possible. He told Harry that the mirror was to be moved to a new location, and warned Harry to not go looking for it. Before he left, Harry asked the headmaster what he saw in the mirror. Much to his surprise, Dumbledore told Harry that he saw himself with a pair of woollen socks. Despite his promise to Dumbledore, Harry found it difficult to forget the image of his parents, until <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Wood" title="Oliver Wood">Wood</a> told the team that Snape would be refereeing the next Quidditch match against <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a>.

<p>Shortly before the match, <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Malfoy</a>, ever eager to pick on <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville</a>, used the <a href="/wiki/Leg-Locker_Curse" title="Leg-Locker Curse">Leg-Locker Curse</a> on Neville, forcing him to bunny hop his way back to the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Tower" title="Gryffindor Tower">Common Room</a>. Harry told Neville he was "worth twelve of Malfoy" and gave him a <a href="/wiki/Chocolate_Frog" title="Chocolate Frog">Chocolate Frog</a>. Thanking Harry, Neville handed the card back to Harry for his collection. Looking down, Harry noted it was Dumbledore's card, the first he ever got. He turned the card over and suddenly remembered where he read the name Nicolas Flamel before: on the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">train on the way to school</a>.
</p><p>As the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> vs. Hufflepuff Quidditch match drew nearer, tensions mounted in the school; Gryffindor had failed to overtake Slytherin in the <a href="/wiki/Inter-House_Quidditch_Cup" title="Inter-House Quidditch Cup">Inter-House Quidditch Cup</a> for seven years, and Harry was worried that it would be impossible with Snape as a referee. Unknown to Harry, Ron and Hermione had been practising the Leg-Locker Curse to use on Snape, should he show any signs of wanting to harm Harry. Before the match began, Wood took Harry aside and reminded him that he needed to catch the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Snitch" title="Golden Snitch">Snitch</a> as soon as he could, before Snape could favour Hufflepuff too much. Harry performed his role as <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">Seeker</a> phenomenally, catching the Snitch within five minutes of the game starting, putting Gryffindor in first place for the <a href="/wiki/Inter-House_Quidditch_Cup" title="Inter-House Quidditch Cup">Quidditch Cup</a>.

Remembering what Hagrid told them, Harry began to blow into the wooden flute Hagrid gave him for <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>. From the first notes, Fluffy's eyes began to droop, and he quickly fell asleep. Jumping through the trapdoor, they found themselves in Professor Sprout's room, filled with <a href="/wiki/Devil%27s_Snare" title="Devil&#39;s Snare">Devil's Snare</a>, which almost smothered them.

<p>The next room, Professor Flitwick's, held a bunch of <a href="/wiki/Winged_Keys" title="Winged Keys">flying keys</a> and some <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomsticks</a>. Harry found the correct key, caught it, and unlocked the next door with it. The next room was Professor McGonagall's, and had a large chessboard, for a game of <a href="/wiki/Wizard%27s_Chess" title="Wizard&#39;s Chess">Wizard's Chess</a> which Ron won at the cost of sacrificing himself. Harry and Hermione continued to the next room (leaving an unconscious Ron where they could return for him), to find an unconscious <a href="/wiki/Troll" title="Troll">troll</a>; Professor Quirrell's room. Lastly, they entered Professor Snape's room, and found seven potions in bottles along with a roll of paper giving clues on which one to drink to continue: a logic puzzle. Hermione solved the puzzle, and at Harry's urging, drank the potion that allowed her to head back so that she could get Ron out, while Harry drank the potion to go forward to the final room.

<p>Once inside the room, Harry's attention was drawn to two things: the <a href="/wiki/Mirror_of_Erised" title="Mirror of Erised">Mirror of Erised</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirrell</a>. Quirrell bound Harry before explaining that the Mirror was the key to finding the Stone. Desperate to distract him from the Mirror, Harry questioned Quirrell, who revealed that was serving <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, and although Snape hated Harry (because Snape allegedly loathed his father in their time at school), he never wanted him dead. Unable to locate the stone, Quirrell asked Voldemort for help; much to Harry's surprise, a voice which seemed to issue from Quirrell himself said "to use the boy".
</p><p>Looking in the Mirror, Harry saw his reflection pull the Stone out of his pocket and replace it, at which point he felt the real Stone drop his real pocket. He told Quirrell that he saw himself winning the House Cup, but Voldemort, an accomplished <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimens</a>, informed Quirrell that Harry was lying, and ordered Quirrell to allow him to speak "to the boy". Quirrell unwrapped his turban, and turned away from Harry. Voldemort, who was sticking out of the back of Quirrell's head, demanded that Harry give him the Stone. Harry refused, and Quirrell seized him, causing Harry's scar to sear with pain; but contact with Harry's skin burned Quirrell's hands, forcing him to release Harry. Harry, realising that contact caused Quirrell pain, grabbed Quirrell's arm and held on until he blacked out.

Harry's second year in <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a> started out badly and gradually got worse. Throughout the preceding summer, the Dursleys became so fearful of his newly discovered magical abilities that they locked away all of his school supplies immediately after his return home to them. They even went as far as to ban him from saying words pertaining or related to magic in general, as evident to Harry getting reprimanded by <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Uncle Vernon</a> for saying the word "magic" at the breakfast table one day. This, however, did not stop Harry from exploiting their paranoia in order to have quiet time alone, such as taunting <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley</a> with made-up magical <a href="/wiki/Incantation" title="Incantation">incantations</a> (like <a href="/wiki/Jiggery_Pokery" title="Jiggery Pokery">Jiggery Pokery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hocus_Pocus" title="Hocus Pocus">Hocus Pocus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Squiggly_wiggly" title="Squiggly wiggly">Squiggly wiggly</a>) whenever the latter teased him. Furthermore, he had no contact with any of his friends nor any news from the wizarding world, and <a href="/wiki/Hedwig" title="Hedwig">Hedwig</a> took to making noise out of boredom from being padlocked in her cage.

</p><p>Harry was too embarrassed by this publicity stunt, and gave the books to Ginny since he could afford a set of his own. Draco went over to congratulate him for being unable to avoid making the front page when walking into a bookstore, but then his father moved him aside to have a one-on-one argument with Mr Weasley over the latter's obsession with Muggles (finding an example of which in Hermione's parents, both Muggle dentists), provoking Weasley into lunging at him. Hagrid broke up the fight just in time, but not before the senior Malfoy slipped a <a href="/wiki/T._M._Riddle%27s_Diary" title="T. M.

<p>When Harry and Ron tried to get onto <a href="/wiki/Platform_Nine_and_Three-Quarters" title="Platform Nine and Three-Quarters">Platform 9¾</a> to join Hermione and the rest of the Weasleys, the barrier mysteriously sealed and they hit the wall.

<p>The next day at breakfast, Ron received a <a href="/wiki/Howler" title="Howler">Howler</a> from his mother, who told him that he would be brought home if he broke another rule. The day only got worse when the Gryffindors attended their first Defence Against the Dark Arts class. Lockhart's teaching was a disaster, since the first thing he did was give them a pop quiz on himself and claimed the answers could be found in his books. He then let a cage of "freshly caught" Cornish <a href="/wiki/Pixie" title="Pixie">Pixies</a> loose and struggled to round them up, but ran to hide from them leaving his young pupils to save the day.
</p><p>As the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">DADA</a> lessons continued, Harry found himself having to act out scenes from Lockhart's books as he read them in class. Lockhart was in love with fame and kept bothering Harry, who had to help him answer his fan-mail while Ron had to polish the school's prizes and trophies. But he was not the only one who paid him extra attention: Many <a href="/wiki/First_year" title="First year">first-year</a> <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindors</a> like <a href="/wiki/Colin_Creevey" title="Colin Creevey">Colin Creevey</a> were star-struck by Harry, and Ginny had a huge crush on him that developed over the summer since she first saw the famous Potter on Platform 9¾ at the start and end of his first year. After hours of tedious work, Harry heard a disembodied, sinister voice, which Lockhart was unable to hear.

<p>Hermione wanted to research the Chamber of Secrets, so she talked <a href="/wiki/History_of_Magic" title="History of Magic">History of Magic</a> Professor Cuthbert Binns into telling the class about its origin. To begin the story, Binns explained that it all started with the founding of Hogwarts itself around <a href="/wiki/First_millennium_A.D." title="First millennium A.D.">990 A.D.</a>, at the hands of two of the greatest wizards and two of the greatest witches of the age: <a href="/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor" title="Godric Gryffindor">Godric Gryffindor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Helga_Hufflepuff" title="Helga Hufflepuff">Helga Hufflepuff</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rowena_Ravenclaw" title="Rowena Ravenclaw">Rowena Ravenclaw</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">Salazar Slytherin</a>. But Slytherin got into an argument with the other founders about whether Muggle-borns should be admitted and, when the rift grew too large between him and Gryffindor, he left the school. According to legend, he built a going-away present to the school in the form of a secret chamber that could only be opened by his true heir. This "Chamber of Secrets" allegedly contained a <a href="/wiki/Serpent_of_Slytherin" title="Serpent of Slytherin">monster</a> that, once released, would purge the school of all <a href="/wiki/Muggle-borns" class="mw-redirect" title="Muggle-borns">Muggle-borns</a>. Professor Binns unsuccessfully tried to assure the class that the Chamber did not actually exist and that the school had been searched many times in vain.
</p><p>Harry, Ron and Hermione decided that the heir was probably <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>. To try to prove it, Hermione proposed to use the <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a>, which can change one's appearance into somebody else's for an hour. Hermione warned that the potion would take a month to brew, supposing they gathered all the necessary ingredients (one of which could only be found in <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Professor Snape</a>'s private inventory) and managed to keep it a secret.

<p>During the month that it took the <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a> to brew, a <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> match between <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> took place. <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> had been made Slytherin's new <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">Seeker</a>, on the merit of his father's generous contribution to the team: a set of <a href="/wiki/Nimbus_2001" title="Nimbus 2001">Nimbus 2001</a> brooms. During the match one of the Bludgers took after Harry and focused completely on him. Malfoy lost no time in making fun of the manoeuvres Harry had to perform in order to avoid the Bludger. Since <a href="/wiki/Bludger" title="Bludger">Bludgers</a> were supposed to attack each and every player, the crowd soon realised that this Bludger had been tampered with. Harry still managed to catch the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Snitch" title="Golden Snitch">Snitch</a> and <span style="font-weight:normal;">Gryffindor won</span>. He caught it right out from under Malfoy's nose, who was more focused on taunting Harry then looking for the Snitch. However, the Bludger broke his arm and Lockhart in his attempt to fix it removed all of the bones instead. <a href="/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey" title="Poppy Pomfrey">Madam Pomfrey</a> gave Harry a potion called <a href="/wiki/Skele-Gro" title="Skele-Gro">Skele-Gro</a>, to counter this and he was forced to stay in the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Wing" title="Hospital Wing">Hospital Wing</a> overnight.

<p>Harry signed up for a <a href="/wiki/Duelling_Club" title="Duelling Club">Duelling Club</a>, which was (to Harry's great displeasure) taught by his two least favourite teachers: <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" title="Gilderoy Lockhart">Lockhart</a> and <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a>. The event was scheduled to take place in the Great Hall. During the club's first meeting Lockhart demonstrated an ineptitude. He was successfully disarmed by Snape and floundered throughout the entire practice duel. Also during a practice battle in the first meeting, <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> conjured a snake to attack Harry. Malfoy conjured this snake via instructions from Snape. Lockhart tried to banish it, but all he managed was to set it loose on the students.
</p><p>Harry saw that the snake was rapidly advancing on a Muggle-born student and <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a> named <a href="/wiki/Justin_Finch-Fletchley" title="Justin Finch-Fletchley">Justin Finch-Fletchley</a> (who had introduced himself to Harry before this incident) and instinctively told it to stop, which — to Harry's great surprise — it did. The others students were less than ecstatic about this development, however. All they saw was Harry speaking <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parseltongue</a>, the language of snakes and became afraid. Since they could not understand it, it seemed to them that he was egging the snake on. It turned out that Parseltongue was a very rare gift that was closely associated with <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">Salazar Slytherin</a>. This was something Slytherin was famous for, hence why the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent. Due to this, Harry became the number one suspect among students for being the heir of Slytherin. Hermione even told him that since Salazar Slytherin lived so long ago, he might actually be.

<p>Weeks later, Ron and Harry overheard <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch">Argus Filch</a> complaining about his workload and leaving. They arrive at <a href="/wiki/Myrtle_Warren" title="Myrtle Warren">Myrtle Warren</a>'s bathroom to find it flooded. Myrtle, a sulking <a href="/wiki/Ghost" title="Ghost">ghost</a>, explained that she had flooded it because somebody threw a diary at her. Harry picked it up; it turned out to have belonged to a T.M. Riddle and appeared to be completely blank. Ron remembered from his detention that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Riddle</a> had won an award for special service to the school fifty years before. Hermione deduced that since this coincided with the last time the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber</a> was opened, Tom Riddle might have received his prize for catching whoever was responsible for the attacks back then. Even though all attempts to extract information from the diary failed, Harry felt a strange compulsion to keep it.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day" title="Valentine&#39;s Day">Valentine's Day</a>, Ron and Harry were dismayed to find out Lockhart had spread dwarves dressed as cupids throughout the school to receive and deliver Valentines. One cupid-dwarf managed to deliver one to Harry. While struggling to avoid him, the embarrassed Harry tripped and fell, spilling ink all over the contents of his bag. Ginny noticed the diary and assumed a horrified expression.

<p>Later, Harry realised that even though the ink was spilled all over the diary, it was not stained at all. He tried writing to the diary and, to his surprise, the diary — or rather T.M. Riddle — began to write back. Riddle explained that he was the one who caught the person who opened the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> the last time, and he could show Harry what happened. Harry agreed and got sucked into a "recording" of Riddle's memory.
</p><p>Harry witnessed the school's previous headmaster, <a href="/wiki/Armando_Dippet" title="Armando Dippet">Armando Dippet</a>, informing Riddle that the school would be closed and Riddle, apprehensive of this, catching <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> fiddling with a large spider in a box. Riddle reported Hagrid to Dippet. During the memory, Harry also learned that Riddle was an orphan that did not want to go back to the orphanage, and his full name was <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a>. Having seen this, Harry wondered whether Hagrid was the one who opened the Chamber fifty years before and whether he was responsible this time. This was exactly what Riddle wanted.

<p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione decided not to ask Hagrid about it, hoping that the attacks had stopped — and indeed, almost four months after the attack on <a href="/wiki/Justin_Finch-Fletchley" title="Justin Finch-Fletchley">Justin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington" title="Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington">Nearly-Headless Nick</a>, the disembodied voice kept quiet and the attacks seemed to have ceased.

He also stressed that if anybody at Hogwarts needed help, it would always be available.

<p>Harry and Ron decided to follow the spiders as per Hagrid's advice. Walking along the trails of the spiders, which were strangely all fleeing <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, take them into the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>. Even though Ron was deeply arachnophobic, the fact that Hermione had been petrified and that they may be able to help through this investigation gave him the willpower to go along anyway. There, they encountered the <a href="/wiki/Flying_Ford_Anglia" title="Flying Ford Anglia">Ford Anglia</a>, which had apparently taken to driving through the forest like some sort of wild animal. They eventually meet Aragog, a giant spider which had been the monster Hagrid had been "caught" setting on other students fifty years ago. Aragog explained that <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> was innocent, but rather than letting Harry and Ron go, he decided to leave them as dinner for his children. <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Mr Weasley</a>'s Ford Anglia came blasting through the layers of spiders, however, and assisted the boys' escape.
</p><p>After this, Harry and Ron felt that they had reached dead ends everywhere, until one possible last hope occurred to them. Aragog said the monster's last victim died in a bathroom, and it occurred to Harry that <a href="/wiki/Myrtle_Warren" title="Myrtle Warren">Myrtle Warren</a> might have been that victim. Of course, with the school under such security, it would be almost impossible to sneak in the girls' bathroom near where the first attack occurred.

She discovered, based on strong circumstantial evidence, that the monster in the Chamber of Secrets was a <a href="/wiki/Serpent_of_Slytherin" title="Serpent of Slytherin">Basilisk</a> (a giant slithering serpent capable of feeding on human and animal aura to cause petrifaction and death to anyone near it via direct eye contact), which explained why only Harry could hear it. But none of its victims died because they didn't look at its gaze directly: <a href="/wiki/Colin_Creevey" title="Colin Creevey">Colin Creevey</a> saw it through his camera, <a href="/wiki/Justin_Finch-Fletchley" title="Justin Finch-Fletchley">Justin Finch-Fletchley</a> saw it through <a href="/wiki/Nearly-Headless_Nick" class="mw-redirect" title="Nearly-Headless Nick">Nearly-Headless Nick</a> (who was already dead), Mrs Norris saw its reflection in the waters from the flooded bathroom, and Hermione used a mirror to look around corners after figuring things out. There was also a note about how spiders feared the Basilisk (which explained them fleeing Hogwarts) and the rooster's call being potentially fatal to it (which explains Hagrid's roosters having been mysteriously killed during the year). This summed up the years events.

<p>On the note was also scribbled a single word, "pipes", which meant that the serpent moved around through the plumbing. Having solved the mystery, Harry and Ron decided to go to the staff room and report to the teachers. When they got there, they overheard the teachers talking about another attack has occurred. Harry and Ron decided to hide to hear more details, and learning that Ginny had been kidnapped and the heir of <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> had left another message under the previous one: Harry and Ron also heard that <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> would be closed the following day. The teachers then forced <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" title="Gilderoy Lockhart">Lockhart</a> to deal with the monster, as he had been claiming he could handle whatever was responsible for the attacks, irritating the rest of the staff to no end. Looking very crestfallen, he left for his room.

<p>Harry, Ron, and Lockhart slid down a large pipe and found themselves in maze-like tunnels far under the school.

Just then, Lockhart feigned fainting and stole Ron's wand. Victoriously proclaiming that he would erase Harry and Ron's memories and tell everybody they lost their sanity at the sight of Ginny's mangled body, Lockhart attempted a spell. <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley%27s_first_wand" class="mw-redirect" title="Ronald Weasley&#39;s first wand">Ron's broken wand</a> caused the charm to backfire, erasing Lockhart's memory and causing a portion of the ceiling to cave in.

Harry then encountered a wall with stone snakes on it, opened it by speaking <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parseltongue</a>, and enters the Chamber itself.

Not wanting to waste all the years he spent on figuring out where the chamber was and how to get to it, he left behind a diary containing the memory of his sixteen-year-old self in hopes that it would, one day, fall into the hands of an unsuspecting victim who would help him finish his work.

Riddle had written back sympathetically and Ginny grew to confess her fears, hopes and feelings to him. She essentially poured some of her soul into him, which was exactly what he wanted. He gradually grew more powerful and eventually managed to pour some of his soul back into her, possessing her and using her body to open the chamber and launch the new series of attacks. However, eventually Ginny became suspicious of the diary and decided to get rid of it by flushing it down the toilet in <a href="/wiki/Myrtle_Warren" title="Myrtle Warren">Myrtle Warren</a>'s bathroom. This is when Harry found it. When Ginny saw Harry with the diary on Valentine's Day, she panicked and worried that Riddle had told all of her secrets to Harry, so she stole it back from Harry's dormitory. It began taking control of her again, but this time with the intention of killing Harry, so he had Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down to wait, luring Harry to the rescue and, consequently, his doom.

However, <a href="/wiki/Fawkes" title="Fawkes">Fawkes</a> was not as defenceless as one might initially think, and pecked out the basilisk's eyes, thus preventing its gaze from killing. The basilisk could still smell Harry, however, and remained very dangerous; Harry, in desperation, put on the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, wishing against hope for help. Instead of an answer, Harry had a heavy sword with a hilt embedded with rubies fall on his head from inside the hat. After several missed strikes from the blinded basilisk, Harry plunged the sword into the roof of its mouth, killing it. However, one of its poisonous fangs sank into his arm, injecting a deadly poison. While Riddle gloated over his "win", Fawkes proceeded to cry on the wound and Harry was instantly cured.

<p>Harry then stabbed the diary three times with the Basilisk fang to rid himself of Riddle, unknowingly destroying one of Voldemort's Horcruxes in the process. Riddle's manifestation exploded, therefore foiling his attempt to come back to life. Ink began pouring out of the book and the memory of Riddle faded out of existence; Ginny immediately stirred and woke up, quite distraught. Harry and Ginny travelled back through the Chamber to find Ron and Lockhart, who had no idea of who or where he was.

<p>Harry's third year in <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a> started out almost as bad as the year prior, and gradually got depressing. Throughout the preceding summer, the Dursleys became fearful of his magical abilities getting exposed that they banned him from talking to the neighbours immediately after his return home to them. They even went as far as punishing him for giving their phone number to his friends, as evident to Harry getting reprimanded by <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Uncle Vernon</a> when the latter received a call from Ron. This, however, did not stop Harry from studying magic every night by sneaking his school supplies and hiding them in his room one night while <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley" title="Petunia Dursley">Aunt Petunia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley</a> were out admiring Vernon's new company car.

The sight of a copy of the <i>Daily Prophet </i>among the mail from Errol interested Harry, as it said that Ron had returned from a trip to <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> to visit his oldest brother <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a> (a <a href="/wiki/Curse-Breaker" title="Curse-Breaker">Curse-Breaker</a> of <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts</a>) for which <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> paid using seven hundred galleons he won in the <a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet_Grand_Prize_Galleon_Draw" title="Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw">Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw</a>.

<p>When his <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade_permission_form" title="Hogsmeade permission form">Hogsmeade permission form</a> was delivered, Harry was worried of the trouble he'll probably go through in order to persuade his aunt or uncle to sign it. They agreed to do so the next morning, but only if he behaved during Marge's visit. However, Marge began insulting the memory of Harry's mother at the dinner table three days later, describing her as a "bad egg" who ran off with a "scoundrel" and left the Dursleys with Harry as the "result in front of them". Harry lost his temper to this, inadvertently making Marge's wine glass explode. The insults transitioned to his father on the final day of her visit, making him very upset to such extent that he ended up losing all control of his magic powers and <a href="/wiki/Blowing-up_of_Marjorie_Dursley" class="mw-redirect" title="Blowing-up of Marjorie Dursley">accidentally inflated her</a>, possibly with an <a href="/wiki/Engorgement_Charm" title="Engorgement Charm">Engorgement Charm</a>.

He found this odd, since Scabbers originally belonged to Ron's older brother <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley" title="Percy Weasley">Percy Weasley</a>.

But the conversation which a worried <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly Weasley</a> was having with her husband soon caught his attention, so Harry listened to what they were saying about Sirius Black's escape, and what connection it had to Harry himself. According to Mr Weasley, when Voldemort met his downfall, Black lost everything he hoped to gain, but to that day he remained a faithful servant to the Dark Lord's cause.
</p><p>The Ministry feared that the killer's motive was to use Harry to return his master to full strength, as evident to the report from Fudge's inspection of <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> saying that Black was repeatedly muttering "<i>He's at Hogwarts</i>" in his sleep. This shook Harry a little to the realisation that Fudge let him go because he was relieved to see Harry all right after running away. Though he was convinced that Hogwarts was a a safe haven because of the presence of Albus Dumbledore, the senior Weasleys agreed that Black could break into the school if he could break out of his Azkaban.

<p>The night after the match, while the Irish team's supporters were still celebrating, a group of black-cloaked, <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">hooded figures</a> held terrifying celebrations of their own by suspending the <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> camp site manager and his family in air like twisted marionettes probably done via <i><a href="/wiki/Levicorpus" title="Levicorpus">Levicorpus</a></i>.

The trio ran into <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> in the woods, and he all but told them that his father was among the cloaked wizards.

<p>Later, Harry learned that <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">Barty Crouch Jnr</a> had stolen his wand from his pocket.

<p>Around Hallowe'en, the students from Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and Durmstrang Institute arrived at the school. The arrival of famous international Quidditch Star Viktor Krum caused a lot of excitement, particularly among girls. <a href="/wiki/Viktor_Krum" title="Viktor Krum">Viktor Krum</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> were all chosen to represent their respective schools in this tournament. However, Harry was mysteriously chosen as a fourth competitor. This came as a shock for all those present, due to the fact that he was under-age and that he never entered his name into the <a href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a> during the selection process. Many people (even Ron and fellow <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindors</a>) did not believe Harry's story. They thought this to be nothing but another attempt to gain even more fame and eternal glory. This caused extreme tension between the two friends and they did not speak again for a long time. Ron started spending more time with <a href="/wiki/Dean_Thomas" title="Dean Thomas">Dean Thomas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seamus_Finnigan" title="Seamus Finnigan">Seamus Finnigan</a>.
</p><p>Hermione on the other hand "<i>accepted his story without question</i>" and explains the reason behind Ron's recent actions toward Harry, stating that it steams from jealousy. She later assisted Harry in preparing for the Tournament by teaching him useful spells, such as the <a href="/wiki/Summoning_Charm" title="Summoning Charm">Summoning Charm</a>. Harry used this charm in the first task of the Tournament. The champions were to face three dangerous challenges on their way to the Triwizard Cup. These challenges were in correspondence to the four elements.

Harry faced even more turmoil during this time, as the majority of the student body was making everyday life difficult for him. <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a> belived that Harry was stealing spotlight from their house and Draco Malfoy was doing everything in his power to make Harry even more miserable. He accomplished this by making and mass producing "POTTER STINKS" badges, which many students proceeded to wear around. Malfoy had also taking to commenting and reading aloud Rita Skeeter's articles every chance he got, making Harry very uncomfortable.

Harry received help from <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a>, who showed the dragons to him and Madam Maxime. Realising that every champion but Cedric had found out about the dragons, Harry told Cedric about the first task. He did this as a way of levelling the playing field.

Instead he advised Harry to play to his strengths, hinting that he should use his <a href="/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">flying</a> ability to get the golden egg.

Harry used a Summoning Charm to bring him his Firebolt and dodged the Hungarian Horntail to get the golden egg. Harry escaped the dangerous task with a mild cut to the arm, due to being grazed by one of the Horntail's spikes. He also proved to be the fastest when it came to capturing his egg, which earned him a compliment from Professor McGonagall. He and Viktor Krum tied for first at the end of the task. After seeing how dangerous the task was, Ron decided that Harry did not put his own name in the Goblet. He made amends with Harry.

<p>While at the ball both Harry and Ron ended up neglecting their dates. Harry watched Cho with Cedric and Ron was overcome with jealousy for Viktor Krum, who danced with Hermione. After the Yule Ball, Rita Skeeter struck again. She had overheard Hagrid telling <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Madame Maxime</a> about his family and his heritage. She then wrote an article exposing Hagrid as a <a href="/wiki/Half-giant" title="Half-giant">half-giant</a>, and he was so ashamed that he stopped teaching and stopped coming to meals in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Hall" title="Great Hall">Great Hall</a>. Dumbledore tried to bring him around by visiting his hut, but to no avail. Only after Harry, Ron, and Hermione proved that they still liked and that it did not matter to them that he was half-giant did he finally return to his post.

<p>Harry was left alone in the office after Dumbledore, Fudge, and Moody left to examine the school grounds. While looking around, Harry noticed Dumbledore's <a href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>. Through curiosity, Harry peered in and ended up looking into three of Dumbledore's memories, from the days immediately after the end of the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>. The first was the trial of <a href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a>, in which he renounced his support of the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> and gave the names of existing Death Eaters, including Snape. Dumbledore (in the memory) stated that Snape had defected the Death Eaters and was a spy against Voldemort and no longer a threat. The second memory showed the trial of <a href="/wiki/Ludovic_Bagman" title="Ludovic Bagman">Ludo Bagman</a>, who was accused of passing information to Voldemort, but his popularity quickly cleared him. The third was the trial of the <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_family" title="Lestrange family">Lestranges</a> (<a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rodolphus_Lestrange" title="Rodolphus Lestrange">Rodolphus</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rabastan_Lestrange" title="Rabastan Lestrange">Rabastan</a>) and Crouch's son, for the use of the Cruciatus Curse on <a href="/wiki/Alice_Longbottom" title="Alice Longbottom">Alice</a> and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Longbottom" title="Frank Longbottom">Frank Longbottom</a>.

<p>This graveyard was the Riddle family's final resting place, where <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> was waiting. Just as Harry and Cedric are trying to figure out what happened, someone appears and Harry's scar begins hurting again. Acting on Voldemort's orders, his servant <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Wormtail</a> murdered Cedric with the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>. Harry saw a flash of green light and heard Cedric's body hit the graveyard's ground with a thud. Harry is then dragged to a large marble tombstone, with the name Tom Riddle engraved upon were he is bound. From there he was forced to witness a ritual in which Pettigrew used some of Harry's blood to <a href="/wiki/Rebirth_of_Lord_Voldemort" class="mw-redirect" title="Rebirth of Lord Voldemort">restore Voldemort's body</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> were summoned to the cemetery.
</p><p>After his Death Eaters arrived, Voldemort spends time criticising them for failing to seek him out during these last thirteen years, even though they knew that he had found a way to escape mortal death. He then rewards Wormtail for aiding with his rebirth by creating a new silver hand for him. The Dark Lord identifies more Death Eaters and reveals that this servant who is at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> has ensured that Harry would win the tournament and be brought to the graveyard. Voldemort then frees the injured and weakened Harry and orders him to face him in a <a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">duel</a>, wishing to prove who among the two is stronger in front of his minions now that there is no one around to protect Harry.

<p>In a terrible turn of fate Crouch's soul was destroyed by the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a>, from the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementor</a> that accompanied <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>. Fudge felt that his personal safety was in jeopardy, hince why he brought the Dementor. As a result, Crouch Jnr could not give testimony and the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> began to dispute Harry's and Dumbledore's insistence that Voldemort had returned. The Minister refused to believe Harry's account of Voldemort's return, even when he was supported by Albus Dumbledore. This was due to Fudge not wanting the peace and tranquillity they worked so hard for to be destabilised by this announcement. The Ministry publicly denied the Dark Lord's return and branded Harry and Dumbledore either liars or nutters in the press. Voldemort and his Death Eaters took advantage of this to operate in secret, while Dumbledore called for a reconstitution of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>.

He was threatened with expulsion from Hogwarts, but was exonerated with help from Dumbledore, who had a witness and legal loopholes to help him.

<p>In retaliation against Dumbledore, <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a> <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> appointed <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, his Senior Under-Secretary, as the new Hogwarts Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher so that she could spy on the school. She was later appointed <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_High_Inquisitor" title="Hogwarts High Inquisitor">Hogwarts High Inquisitor</a>, empowered to arbitrarily change and impose school rules whenever she chose. She made numerous rules that the students were expected to follow and if they did not harsh punishments would be enacted. Umbridge proved to be sadistic and cruel, with a personality that resembled poisioned honey.
</p><p>Harry hated her on sight and she had a deep dislike for him as well. This dislike bordered on hatred and came about because of her inability to control him. Every time Harry spoke out of turn or even mentioned Voldemort, Umbridge threw him into detention. The detentions he had with her were torturous, forcing him to write with a Black Quill. The Black Quill was of her own invention and it made him write with his own blood, scribed the message "<i>I must not tell lies</i>" onto the back of his hand. Harry had to endure numerous sessions with the quill, so many that the words are now permanently carved into his hand. These detentions however did not sway him from his opinions or make him subservient to Umbridge. They had the opposite effect and strengthen his resolve to stand by his statements of <a href="/wiki/Voldemort%27s_return" class="mw-redirect" title="Voldemort&#39;s return">Voldemort's return</a> .

<p>However, Umbridge presumed the message had failed to sink in, as Harry spread the word through <i><a href="/wiki/The_Quibbler" title="The Quibbler">The Quibbler</a></i> about the previous year's events, and thus he was banned from any more <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> visits. Also once Umbridge found out that he gave <i>The Quibbler</i> an exclusive interview she banned the magazine, which caused the whole student body to take an interest in it. Later in the year Ron was chosen to be a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">prefect</a>, not him. This surprised everyone, as they all believed that Harry would have gotten the badge instead of Ron. It was later revealed that Ron was chosen instead of Harry because <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> thought that Harry had "<i>enough responsibility to be going on with</i>". Harry's jealousy threatened to affect his friendship with Ron, but he felt better when he discovered that his father was also not chosen as a prefect at school. This suggests that Harry's desire in becoming prefect was to emulate his father, who was <a href="/wiki/Head_Boy_or_Girl" title="Head Boy or Girl">Head Boy</a> in his day, not to inflate a sense of his own importance.

<p>Giving into Hermione's persistent urgings Harry secretly trained a group of students in practical defensive magic. In an attempt to make light of the Ministry's fears the group called themselves <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a> (or the D.A.). Aware that arranging meetings and passing the word about them verbally was not a secure method of communication, Hermione bewitched several coins with a <a href="/wiki/Protean_Charm" title="Protean Charm">Protean Charm</a> one for each member of the D.A. When activated by Harry, the numbers on each coin would change to inform the bearer of the time and date of the next meeting. Feeling highly anxious and frustrated most of the time Harry found that the D.A. was now his chief source of happiness, and the thing to which he looked forward throughout his school day. This happiness was felt by most members, as all of them (particularly Neville and the <a href="/wiki/Creevey_family" title="Creevey family">Creevey</a> brothers) gained a lot of skills under Harry's tutelage.

<p>Harry taught the group many different spells, ranking from the simplistic <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Disarming Charm</a> to the highly advanced Patronus Charm. The class progressed at a fair rate, practising the: <a href="/wiki/Impediment_Jinx" title="Impediment Jinx">Impediment Jinx</a>, <a href="/wiki/Reductor_Curse" title="Reductor Curse">Reductor Curse</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">Stunning Spell</a>, and various other hexes and jinxes before temporarily breaking up for Christmas break. Lessons continued during the early months of 1996, The class mastered the <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">Shield Charm</a>, and began to work on the Patronus Charm. Some members were even able to produe corporeal Patronuses, Harry thought this might have been due to the lack of <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> present, as there was nothing to make the students scared.

<p><a href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> also became a member. During the meetings whenever Harry was near, she would become so flustered that she had difficulty casting spells correctly. Before the <a href="/wiki/Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> holidays, she and Harry were discussing how she had never been able to pull of the Stunning Spell before, when the room generated mistletoe. The room did this due to sensing the tension that was present. Under the mistletoe, the two kissed for the first time. This moment was confusing to Harry, as Cho, clearly still suffering from her ex-boyfriend's death, had been crying during their kiss. Cho's crying during the kiss also caused concern in Harry. Harry later informed Hermione and Ron of his disastrous first kiss and Hermione comforted him saying that it was not his kissing that made Cho cry.

<p>However, Harry took on some much more pressing worries later that night. <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, wanting a "secret weapon" against him, had heard of a <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">prophecy</a> hidden in the Ministry's <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a> concerning both of them. Voldemort had been obsessing over the door to the <a href="/wiki/Hall_of_Prophecy" title="Hall of Prophecy">Hall of Prophecy</a> for the past few months, and had been inadvertently allowing Harry to read his thoughts through <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a>. The link between Harry and Voldemort's minds had been growing stronger for quite a while. As a result, after falling asleep on the night of his kiss with Cho, Harry witnessed <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a> <a href="/wiki/Attack_on_Arthur_Weasley" title="Attack on Arthur Weasley">attack</a> Arthur Weasley in his dream, and felt almost as if he had been the snake. Realising what could happen if the link grew more powerful, Dumbledore commissioned Snape to train Harry in Occlumency in an effort to prevent further problems.
</p><p>Critically injured, Arthur was taken to <a href="/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries" title="St Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries">St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries</a>. Harry, Ron, Ginny, Fred, and George took a portkey to Grimmauld Place. When they arrive at headquarters, they were greeted by Sirius, who ordered them to stay put and wait for news. Mrs Weasley stated that Arthur survived the attack and was grateful towards Harry. Even though Arthur survived, he was required to take a <a href="/wiki/Blood-Replenishing_Potion" title="Blood-Replenishing Potion">Blood-Replenishing Potion</a> at regular intervals. Mr Weasley also shared the ward with a man who had been bitten by a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> and a woman with a massive chunk out of her leg who refused to tell the <a href="/wiki/Healer" title="Healer">Healers</a> what had bitten her, arousing suspicions she had been handling something illegal.

<p>Hermione joined Harry and the Weasleys at Grimmauld Place for Christmas, and <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley" title="Percy Weasley">Percy</a> sent back his Weasley jumper, which made his mother cry. Hermione, Ron and Ginny discovered that Neville's parents were insane and living at St Mungo's. They were informed of this by Neville's grandmother, who made it known that Frank and Alice were tortured by Death Eaters for information regarding Voldemort. They also saw their former <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" title="Gilderoy Lockhart">Gilderoy Lockhart</a>. Also Harry finally admitted that he knew what happened to Neville's parents.
</p><p>Unfortunately, Harry did not enjoy having his mind peered into and did not focus on using Occlumency, having indeed been extremely curious about the door himself. During a lesson in Occlumency, Snape stepped out of the room, and Harry's curiosity got the best of him. He looked into the <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore%27s_Pensieve" class="mw-redirect" title="Albus Dumbledore&#39;s Pensieve">pensieve</a>, which contained Snape's memories, and, to his dismay, Harry found images of his father bullying Snape and of his mother rushing to his defence. Harry found himself siding with his mother, agreeing that James' treatment of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> was wrong and it bordered on being almost cruel.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">&#91;80&#93;</a></sup> The conflict escalated to the point where Snape called Lily a "Mudblood," an act that cost him his friendship with her. Snape himself discovered Harry's spying. <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> refused to give him any more <a href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a> lessons, something that Harry was not particularly concerned about and something he did not inform anyone of. Uncovering the source behind Snape's hatred for <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> left Harry seeing his father in a slightly different light. He also found comfort in the fact that at least his mother appeared to be person of strong morals while wondering why she ever agreed to marry James in the first place.

<p>As the second term progressed, Harry's relationship with Cho became more strained. While the two did like each other, Cho was mistakenly jealous of <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> due to the latter's closeness with Harry, and Harry still felt awkward about Cho's feelings over Cedric. When Cho's friend, <a href="/wiki/Marietta_Edgecombe" title="Marietta Edgecombe">Marietta Edgecombe</a>, betrayed the <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">D.A.</a> to Umbridge, the members were all punished and forced to end their meetings. Harry was furious with Marietta but Cho insisted on defending her friend. Cho even claimed that it was not Marietta's fault because she was being pressured by her mother. At this point, Cho's and Harry's relationship "fell apart", and the two no longer saw each other romantically. Umbridge is appointed <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">Headmistress</a> and imposes even tighter control. Fred and George Weasley rebelled against the new authority at the school.

<p>Fred and George took it easy during the Easter holidays, but then took their rebellion to a new level. They turned a corridor of the school into a swamp to create a diversion for Harry to access the fireplace in Umbridge's office in an attempt to contact <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius</a>, and were cornered by Umbridge and members of the <a href="/wiki/Inquisitorial_Squad" title="Inquisitorial Squad">Inquisitorial Squad</a>. In a final act of defiance, the twins summoned their brooms, openly mocked Umbridge's authority, struck the Squad members with a variety of jinxes, and escaped the school behind to pursue a career in their joke shop, with the money Harry lent them.

This caused them to miss much of <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> 's Quidditch match. Hagrid also relayed to the trio were he had been during those months that he was away. He along with <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Madam Maxime</a> were given a mission to the Giant Colony, in order to persuade them to join Dumbledore and his cause. This mission proved to be a failure to the Order, as the giants chose to align with the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, due to their shared love of violence and killing.
</p><p>Hagrid had dragged a <a href="/wiki/Giant" title="Giant">giant</a> back with him from his mission over the summer. It transpired that the giant (named Grawp) was Hagrid's half-brother on his mother's side, and that Hagrid had been attempting to civilise the giant, but with few results. He made Harry and Hermione promise that they would look after Grawp, should Hagrid be forced to leave the school for any reason. Hagrid was attacked and left the school during <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_Wizarding_Level" title="Ordinary Wizarding Level">O.W.L.</a> examinations, and thus Harry never had to go down to Grawp in the forest.

<p>Back at Hogwarts, Harry appeared in Dumbledore's office and tried to get out after <a href="/wiki/Phineas_Nigellus_Black" title="Phineas Nigellus Black">Phineas Nigellus Black</a> mentioned Sirius, only to find the door locked. Harry was none too pleased about Dumbledore's name being mentioned by the portraits. When the Headmaster returned, Harry lost his temper and started destroying Dumbledore's possessions, trying to get Dumbledore to let him out; Dumbledore refused, asking Harry to sit down and listen to what Dumbledore needed to say.
</p><p>Dumbledore explained to Harry the real reason why Voldemort tried to kill him as an infant. A prophecy stated that he was destined to defeat the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Lord</a>, for he had powers Voldemort did not: the ability to <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a>, something that the Department of Mysteries was trying to research in a locked room. As a result of the battle, the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> realised that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned, and Harry and Dumbledore were vindicated along with Sirius (though he didn't live long enough to enjoy his freedom, but was honoured as hero by the Ministry). Serious steps were taken following this change in policy, such as the dismissal of Umbridge. However, this was not a sea of change, as the Ministry still had a mistrust of Dumbledore.

<p>Early in his summer, Dumbledore requested that Harry join him in some unknown adventure. He arrived to pick Harry up at <a href="/wiki/4_Privet_Drive" title="4 Privet Drive">4 Privet Drive</a> on a Friday, late in the evening. Harry had not informed his aunt and uncle of this development and it came as a great surprise to them.

Much to his rage, Harry inherited his godfather Sirius Black's estate. This included: 12 Grimmauld Place, the Black family vault, and the Blacks' irritating and half-crazed house elf, <a href="/wiki/Kreacher" title="Kreacher">Kreacher</a>. Harry still retained animosity towards Kreacher after his involvement in Sirius' death a few months previous.

<p>In their time together, Harry and Slughorn discussed some of the professor's old students and the improved security at Hogwarts. When Harry and Dumbledore made to leave, Slughorn agreed to return to the school if he got a raise and a larger office.

While this disappointed Harry greatly, his career as an Auror reopened, as Professor Slughorn would accept his 'Exceeds Expectations' score in Potions.

When Harry examined it, he found that it once had belonged to a student identified only as the "<a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Half-Blood Prince</a>". The book contained copious handwritten notes that helped Harry excel in Potions for once. In fact, his skills won him a prize from Slughorn — a small vial of <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a>, also known as "liquid luck".

<p>The Saturday following Harry's first lessons, while in the Great Hall the trio find out (courtesy of the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">Daily Prophet</a></i>) that <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Shunpike" title="Stanley Shunpike">Stan Shunpike</a> has been arrested for supposed Death Eater activity. Apparently he was over heard talking about the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> secret plans while in a pub. Harry believed that Stan most likely knew nothing regarding secret plans, as Stan had a habit of greatly exaggerating. Afterwards Harry, as the new <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> Quidditch Captain held trials to select the team for the annual Quidditch Cup. Due to Harry's popularity, it proves to be extremely taxing and difficult, with even first-years, <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaws</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuffs</a> turning up for the trials.
</p><p>The first test he administered was a basic flying test, something that proved to be a good idea as it became clear to Harry that most of the students present where not adapt flyers. After an arduous morning of tantrums, foolishness, and many complaints Harry picked the members of his team. The three <a href="/wiki/Chaser" title="Chaser">Chasers</a>, one of which was <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a> (who out flew all her competition and scored seventeen goals), two <a href="/wiki/Beater" title="Beater">Beaters</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> as <a href="/wiki/Keeper" title="Keeper">Keeper</a>.

<p>In studying the Half-Blood Prince's book, Harry discovered numerous hand-written spells that the Prince supposedly invented himself, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Levicorpus" title="Levicorpus">Levicorpus</a></i> and <a href="/wiki/Muffliato_Charm" title="Muffliato Charm"><i>Muffliato</i></a>. He tried these spells and became increasingly fascinated with the book, going as far as having it on him at all times. This was something that his friends were quick to comment on, stating that "<i>all he does is read that bloody book"</i> and that he "<i>practically sleeps with it</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">&#91;82&#93;</a></sup> Harry even considered the book to be almost a friend, a teacher and sort of guide.
</p><p>Hermione disapproved of the book, partly because some of its spells have a dark nature, but mainly because it allows Harry to outperform her in potions. Three times, Slughorn attempts to invite Harry to one of his Slug Club parties, but Harry avoids them. Throughout the autumn, Harry used Quidditch to dodge Professor Slughorn's <a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a> events, doing this because he disliked the idea and because it was kinder than leaving Ron alone as Hermione had been invited as well.

Harry felt annoyance towards Ron and Hermione, as they did not back him up, but he did not give up on his theory.
</p><p>Harry's lessons were quite sporadic that autumn, and he did not have another one until after tragedy befell someone at Hogwarts. In this lesson, Harry first sees <a href="/wiki/Caractacus_Burke" title="Caractacus Burke">Caractacus Burke</a> talking about <a href="/wiki/Slytherin%27s_Locket" title="Slytherin&#39;s Locket">Slytherin's Locket</a> which a pregnant and desperate Merope had sold him, her husband having abandoned her when she stopped giving him love potion. Dumbledore then focused on Tom Riddle just as he was on the cusp of his Hogwarts years, and Harry discovered a troubled orphan who consciously used his magic to bully and intimidate the other children. Also Harry shared his suspicions of Malfoy with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> during their lesson, only to be rebuffed.

In preparation for their first game, Harry replaced the injured Katie Bell with <a href="/wiki/Dean_Thomas" title="Dean Thomas">Dean Thomas</a>. The change produced some results, both expected, as the team excelled on the pitch, and unexpected, as Harry found himself in a jealous rage after seeing Dean kissing Ginny after practice. The team's only problem was Ron, who was suffering from a lack of confidence. In an attempt to boost Ron's confidence, Harry blatantly acted as if he had spiked Ron's pumpkin juice with <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a>. Ron took the bait and played a flawless match; however, Hermione took the bait as well and acted unkindly toward Ron and Harry. While she made up with Harry when he told her of the ruse, Ron's sudden relationship with <a href="/wiki/Lavender_Brown" title="Lavender Brown">Lavender Brown</a> led to continued strife, as it spiked jealousy in Hermione.

<p>By <a href="/wiki/1_March" title="1 March">1 March</a>, Harry had still not acquired Slughorn's true memory and had begun to grow more obsessed with Draco Malfoy. That morning he awoke to find Ron under the influence of a very powerful <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a>, and he took him to Slughorn, only for Ron to end up <a href="/wiki/Plot_to_assassinate_Albus_Dumbledore" title="Plot to assassinate Albus Dumbledore">poisoned</a>. Harry managed to act quickly and save him with a Bezoar. This was enough for Hermione to overcome her animosity toward Ron, and the three became friends again. Ron survived, but was not fit for the upcoming Quidditch match, so he was replaced by McLaggen. This turned out to be a bad choice, as McLaggen accidentally knocked Harry unconscious mid-match. Upon his recovery, Harry had yet another lesson with the Headmaster.

<p>In his lesson with the Headmaster Harry was upbraided by Dumbledore for not completing his assignment, witnessed the young Tom Riddle murder <a href="/wiki/Hepzibah_Smith" title="Hepzibah Smith">Hepzibah Smith</a> for the famous artefacts (<a href="/wiki/Slytherin%27s_Locket" title="Slytherin&#39;s Locket">Slytherin's Locket</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff%27s_Cup" title="Hufflepuff&#39;s Cup">Hufflepuff's Cup</a>) she owned, and jinx the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> post at Hogwarts. However, Harry still could not figure out how to obtain the memory and focused on Malfoy. His interest was bordering on obsession. It was Ron who came up with the solution to Harry's dilemma with Slughorn. He suggested Felix Felicis, liquid luck. In the evening, Harry took the potion and not only managed to obtain the memory, but also solved many of his and his friends's problems, including breaking up not only Ginny Weasley and Dean Thomas, but also Ron and his overly clingy girlfriend Lavender Brown.

<p>Even though it was after midnight, Harry immediately went to Dumbledore with the new memory. It confirmed Dumbledore's theory that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> had created not one but multiple Dark magical objects called Horcruxes to ensure his <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">immortality</a>. Together, they theorised that the Dark Lord had created Horcruxes out of special objects such as <a href="/wiki/T._M._Riddle%27s_Diary" title="T. M. Riddle&#39;s Diary">Riddle's diary</a> and Slytherin's locket. Before Harry left, Dumbledore promised to let Harry join him if he found another Horcrux. With the memory found, Harry had only Quidditch and Malfoy on his mind.

The cave was difficult to enter with a toll paid in blood, and to get to the island in the centre of the cave there was only a small boat.

<p>They next found themselves in a vast chamber containing an underground lake, with a solitary island at its centre from which a faint green light was visible. After a failed attempt by Harry at <a href="/wiki/Summoning_Charm" title="Summoning Charm">Summoning</a> the Horcrux, Dumbledore located a carefully concealed boat that would allow them safe passage across the lake. During the crossing, Harry learned another of the Horcrux's lines of defence. The lake was filled with <a href="/wiki/Inferius" title="Inferius">Inferi</a> (animated corpses of Voldemort's previous victims) which would attack anyone who touched the lake's water. Dumbledore instructed Harry on the use of fire as the weapon of choice against the Inferi, should it become necessary. Inferi fear both light and warmth. The thought of the Inferi hidden below caused Harry unease, but was quickly reassured by Dumbledore.

Harry was reluctant that either one of them drink it, as they did not know its effects, but there was no way to avoid it. Dumbledore extracted a promise from Harry that he would force him to drink, no matter how much he tried to persuade him not to. With this promise, Dumbledore drank and Harry watched as Dumbledore was driven out of his mind, but upheld his promise.
</p><p>Dumbledore drank and experienced intense stomach pains, dehydration and saw visions that mentally tortured him. Harry later thought that Dumbledore saw the duel between him, <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Grindelwald</a>. Harry managed to get the potion down Dumbledore's throat. When they finally finished the potion, Dumbledore fell unconscious. When he was revived by Harry he asked for water. Harry attempted to conjure water for Dumbledore with a <a href="/wiki/Water-Making_Spell" title="Water-Making Spell">Water-Making Charm</a>, but this proved ineffective as the water disappeared before Dumbledore could drink it. This being another defence designed by Voldemort. In desperation Harry filled a cup with water from the lake, triggering the army of Inferi that were waiting below.

<p>As he splashed the water on Dumbledore's face, Harry felt something ice cold on his arm and saw a disgusting hand and the Inferi climbing up from the lake.

<p>After a short broomstick ride through the village they landed atop the <a href="/wiki/Astronomy_Tower" title="Astronomy Tower">Astronomy Tower</a>. Once on the tower they discovered that Hogwarts had been invaded by <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, but Harry's friends Ron, Hermione, <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna</a>, <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville</a>, and Ginny, who had been ordered by Harry to watch the school lest Malfoy accomplish his nefarious goal. The D.A. members battled alongside the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, on the floor below Harry and Dumbledore, with some help from the remainder of Harry's vial of Felix Felicis. Dumbledore had stopped Harry from fighting and frozen him against a wall with a <a href="/wiki/Full_Body-Bind_Curse" title="Full Body-Bind Curse">Full Body-Bind Curse</a>, hidden underneath his <a href="/wiki/Invisibility_cloak" title="Invisibility cloak">invisibility cloak</a>, so all he could do was helplessly watch and wait. While waiting Harry witnessed the death of Albus Dumbledore at the hands of Severus Snape.
</p><p>Dumbledore's body plummeted from the tallest tower at Hogwarts. With Dumbledore dead, Harry was free of the spell that petrified him. He immediately set off after Snape, petrifying a Death Eater and seeking revenge. As the Death Eaters made their way out of Hogwarts Castle and on to the grounds, trying to reach the border where they would be able to <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Apparate</a> again, Harry pursued and faced off against Snape. Harry tried many times to defeat Snape, even weakly attempting the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> and Snape's own hand crafted spells, all with no effect. In the process, Snape identified himself as the Half-Blood Prince, and escaped Hogwarts with <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> and the other Death Eaters.

Harry then told Hagrid that "<i>Snape killed Dumbledore</i>", but Hagrid refused to believe him. Harry and Hagrid returned to the castle to find people staring at Dumbledore's crippled and lifeless body. Harry moved forward the base of the Astronomy Tower and found his mentor's body lying still upon the ground and Hagrid finally believed him. Harry proceeded to stay next to Dumbledore's body thinking that everything that previously happened that night had been all for naught. Harry started crying over Dumbledore’s corpse as well as straightening his half-moon spectacles upon his crooked nose and Harry wiping a trickle of blood from the dead Headmaster’s mouth with his (Harry’s) own sleeve. Hagrid tried many times to get Harry to move, but did not succeed. It was only when he was comforted by Ginny that Harry finally consented to move.

<p>Harry remembering the locket, took it from Dumbledore's robes. He was absolutely beside himself when he learned it was just a plain bit of jewellery. It was in fact a decoy; there was a note inside the locket that revealed the real Horcrux was taken by someone called '<a href="/wiki/Regulus_Black" title="Regulus Black">R.A.B.</a>'. It appeared to Harry that Dumbledore had died in vain and that they had achieved nothing that night. Harry was still processing this information while Ginny escorted him to the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Wing" title="Hospital Wing">Hospital Wing</a> on <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">McGonagall</a>'s orders, all the while holding his hand as means of comfort. Later at the end of the year, Harry would inform Hermione and Ron of the decoy locket.
</p><p>Once in the Hospital Wing he found a injured Neville apparently asleep in bed, as well as: Ron, Hermione, Luna, <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Tonks</a>, <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Lupin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey" title="Poppy Pomfrey">Madam Pomfrey</a>, and Ron's brother <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley.</a> At some point during the battle Bill had been horribly scarred by <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Fenrir Greyback</a>. When Ginny announced that Dumbledore was dead, everyone appeared horrified. Lupin actually lost control for a moment, while Madam Pomfrey burst into tears and McGonagall was weak-kneed. Harry explained to everyone what had happened on the Astronomy Tower and when he was finished, they were all shocked by what he had said. Harry also revealed Dumbledore's apparent reasons for trusting Snape and allowing him a second chance.

Ginny told him that she did not care about the danger of being his girlfriend, but Harry still thought it was best if the two stopped seeing each other. He then spoke to Ron and Hermione, who committed to forgoing their final year at Hogwarts in order to accompany him, despite his protests.

He had to complete it if he was to finally defeat Voldemort. He was joined by Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. With four Horcruxes remaining (plus the unknown soul fragment residing inside Harry) the trio made plans.

<p>After securing <a href="/wiki/Slytherin%27s_locket" class="mw-redirect" title="Slytherin&#39;s locket">Slytherin's locket</a>, the three friends took turns wearing it, to ensure it was not lost. The locket had a negative influence on all of them, straining relations and causing them to all act moody and inclined to get into petty arguments. They overheard a <a href="/wiki/Goblin" title="Goblin">goblin</a> saying that the sword protected by <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> was a fake. They learned that the <a href="/wiki/Sword_of_Gryffindor" title="Sword of Gryffindor">Sword of Gryffindor</a> in Snape's office was a copy of the real sword, and that they would have to trace the location of the real sword.

<p>Harry and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> were excited at knowing what object they could use to destroy Horcruxes, but the locket's negative energy pushed Ron over the edge. Knowing that they now had something they were not close to destroying, Ron and Harry got into a horrible row. Ron accused Harry of not knowing what he was doing and not being very concerned when they learned that <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a> had been punished for attempting to steal Gryffindor’s sword for them, along with <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>. Ron then abandoned his friends accusing Hermione of preferring Harry to himself.
</p><p>Ron’s departure left both Harry and Hermione depressed. After some listless time in which they accomplished nothing, they decided to head to <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a>, as Harry wanted to visit his parents graves, and Hermione had convinced herself that <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> might have entrusted the Sword of Gryffindor to <a href="/wiki/Bathilda_Bagshot" title="Bathilda Bagshot">Bathilda Bagshot</a>, a magical historian who lived there and who had been friendly with the <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">Potters</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore_family" title="Dumbledore family">Dumbledores</a>.

<p>Harry soon became obsessed by the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a>. He spent everyday brooding over the possibilities, forgetting about his responsibilities. With Harry's new found obsession with the Hallows, he became more and more withdrawn and listless.

This obsession troubled his friends, and with the drop in Harry's attentiveness Ron's leadership qualities flourished.

<p>After listening to a broadcast of <i><a href="/wiki/Potterwatch" title="Potterwatch">Potterwatch</a></i> around Easter 1998, Harry determined that Voldemort was seeking the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>, and accidentally broke the <a href="/wiki/Taboo" title="Taboo">Taboo</a> on Voldemort's name. Captured by a gang of Snatchers led by <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Fenrir Greyback</a>, the trio were questioned about who they were. <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> had previously hit Harry in the face with a <a href="/wiki/Stinging_Jinx" title="Stinging Jinx">Stinging Hex</a> in an attempt to conceal their true identities, but it all amounted to nothing as the Snatchers then found the Sword of Gryffindor. After Greyback and <a href="/wiki/Scabior" title="Scabior">Scabior</a> realised that they had caught Harry Potter, the trio were taken to <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a> in Wiltshire. The Snatchers decided to forgo taking Harry to the Ministry, but instead to Voldemort directly.

<p>When <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> learned that Harry had been caught, she immediately sought to summon Voldemort. She planned to do this, until she noticed one of the Snatchers had the Sword of Gryffindor, which was supposed to be in her vault at <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts</a>. From her drastic change in tone of voice and her worries that they would all perish, Harry determined that another Horcrux was hidden there, as well. Bellatrix isolated Hermione for interrogation based on the knowledge that she was <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a>, stating that she wished to talk "girl to girl with her" and proceeded to brutally torture her with the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a>. While being tortured Hermione lied, claiming that the Sword was just a copy. Harry convinced <a href="/wiki/Griphook" title="Griphook">Griphook</a> (a goblin prisoner) to support this story, knowing that Bellatrix would interrogate Griphook next, as she would want a goblin's opinion on the Sword.

<p>Harry, his scar now burning temptingly threatening to have Voldemort's thoughts engulf him, was finally able to learn control of denying Voldemort's entry into his mind. He attributed this to his grief and love for Dobby. While digging the grave, more understanding came to Harry. He realised that though the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a> were tempting objects, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> had tasked him with destroying <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>.

<p>Following the death of Dobby, Harry, Ron, and Hermione stayed at <a href="/wiki/Shell_Cottage" title="Shell Cottage">Shell Cottage</a> for some time. During their stay, the trio formed a plan to break into the <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_Vault" title="Lestrange Vault">Lestrange Vault</a> to obtain the Horcrux within, with the help of <a href="/wiki/Griphook" title="Griphook">Griphook</a>. Due to the fact that Griphook would only help in exchange for Godric Gryffindor's Sword, Harry decided to word his request so that the handover would not take place until after Harry had used it to dispose of the remaining Horcruxes. Harry also found out information regarding the Elder Wand from <a href="/wiki/Garrick_Ollivander" title="Garrick Ollivander">Ollivander</a>. He learned that his hunch that <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a> was real and that Voldemort was going abroad to search for it was correct. Harry also learned some complex <a href="/wiki/Wandlore" title="Wandlore">wandlore</a>, such as what happens when a wand's allegiance changes to that of another individual and that a wand's allegiance doesn't necessarily have to change hands through murder, as most (including <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>) believed.
</p><p>Although feeling guilty for the deception, Harry knew that the sword was their only known weapon against the Horcruxes. The other residents of Shell Cottage could not fail to notice the trio's behaviour. <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a> took Harry aside and advised Harry to be cautious when making deals with Griphook who Harry was increasingly disliking. Around the same time, <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> came to Shell Cottage bearing tidings of new birth. He asked Harry to be the godfather of his newborn child, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">Edward Lupin</a>. It seemed as if the incident between them at <a href="/wiki/12_Grimmauld_Place" title="12 Grimmauld Place">12 Grimmauld Place</a> had never occurred.

<p>The trio and Griphook left Shell Cottage early on the morning of 1 May to break into Gringotts.

<p>Their plan proceeded reasonably well; Hermione made a convincing Bellatrix, despite a close encounter with a <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a> named <a href="/wiki/Travers" title="Travers">Travers</a>, whose suspicions seemed to be eased and accompanied the group to Gringotts.

Inside, the Goblins requested Bellatrix's identification. When Hermione hesitated, one nervously said that her wand was sufficient proof, though Hermione claimed it was new. Harry suspected the goblins knew that Bellatrix's wand was stolen and were looking for an impostor.

Bogrod requested the <a href="/wiki/Clankers" title="Clankers">Clankers</a>, and then led the trio, Griphook, and Travers into a passageway. The door slammed shut, and Harry sent Travers away to hide. Bogrod, still under the Imperius curse, summoned a cart that descended deep within Gringotts. After many twists and turns, the cart passed through <a href="/wiki/Thief%27s_Downfall" title="Thief&#39;s Downfall">Thief's Downfall</a>, a security waterfall that washed away all illusion charms. When the cart overturned and dumped them out, Hermione and Ron had been reverted to themselves. Griphook believed the other Goblins knew they were impostors, but Harry wanted to continue and cursed Bogrod again.

<p>The trio and Griphook found the vault guarded by an aged, half-blind dragon. Griphook subdued it using the Clankers. Hearing pursuit approaching, Harry forced Bogrod to open the vault, which was filled with precious objects.

Hermione levitated Harry by the ankle and he snagged the Cup by using Gryffindor's Sword, as to not be burned by the metal. Meanwhile Hermione, Ron, Griphook, and Bogrod all struggled to stay above the searing-hot rapidly multiplying objects below.

<p>A vision from Voldemort helped Harry realise that the third Horcrux, whilst unbeknownst to him at the time, <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw%27s_Diadem" title="Ravenclaw&#39;s Diadem">Ravenclaw's Diadem</a>, remained at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out on their final mission to return to the school and obtain the diadem, inadvertently tripping the <a href="/wiki/Caterwauling_Charm" title="Caterwauling Charm">Caterwauling Charm</a> upon Apparating to Hogsmeade and thereby alerting the waiting <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> to their presence. Due to the trio being under the <a href="/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility" title="Cloak of Invisibility">Invisibility cloak</a>, however, the Death Eaters resorted to unleashing <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> into the streets to try to force the intruders out of hiding.
</p><p>Having no choice, Harry conjured his <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a> to protect himself and his friends, automatically giving away their position and confirming their identities (the Death Eaters having been pre-warned that Harry Potter's Patronus took the form of a stag).

While Harry, Ron, and Hermione did so, Aberforth remained outside, proclaiming to the Death Eaters that it was he who tripped the alarm (by letting his cat out) and conjured the Patronus to ward off the Dementor threat; mockingly contradicting a Death Eater, saying that what he had seen was a goat Patronus rather than a stag. The incensed Death Eaters believed this and retreated.

<p>After Aberforth re-entered his pub and home, he scolded them for coming to Hogsmeade advising them to leave the country. After Harry engaged in a brief and fierce argument with him, he led the grateful trio directly into Hogwarts through a secret entrance behind the portrait of his deceased sister, <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana Dumbledore</a>. <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> (acting as their escort) then guided them into the <a href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">Room of Requirement</a>, where they were enthusiastically greeted by the reconstituted Dumbledore's Army; most of which were beaten and bruised, yet ready to fight the Death Eaters controlling the school. Harry tried to tell them that he, Ron, and Hermione only returned to find something, but Neville contacted other allies with a call to arms. Harry was initially reluctant to allow the others to help, as he had developed trust issues. But in an attempt to be a better man than Dumbledore (whom he feared he was turning into) and after some discussion with Ron and Hermione, he allowed it.

<p>Harry hesitantly asked the room at large if they had ever heard of any sort of legendary artefact belonging to one of the Founders of Hogwarts. <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a> then elaborated on the fabled Diadem of Ravenclaw, pronouncing that a statue in Ravenclaw Tower depicted <a href="/wiki/Rowena_Ravenclaw" title="Rowena Ravenclaw">Rowena Ravenclaw</a> wearing a diadem. Harry, having no idea of what the diadem looked like, was led by Luna to the Ravenclaw Common Room to observe the statue. Here the pair were ambushed by <a href="/wiki/Alecto_Carrow" title="Alecto Carrow">Alecto Carrow</a> who pressed her Dark Mark immediately upon noticing Harry, summoning Voldemort, before Luna stunned her from under the Invisibility cloak. <a href="/wiki/Amycus_Carrow" title="Amycus Carrow">Amycus Carrow</a> attempted to force his way through the common room door, designed only to open after the door-knocker's question was correctly answered, by seeking the help of <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>, who easily allowed him entry by solving the door's riddle herself; by that time, Harry had managed to rejoin Luna under the Invisibility cloak.
</p><p>Amycus (in fear of his master's wrath) suggested framing Alecto's apparently mistaken summoning of the former on the <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a> students; as he did, he spontaneously devised a lie that made it seem as though the students had forced Alecto to touch her <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> at wand-point. In her outrage, McGonagall strongly insinuated that Amycus was a coward for proposing such an idea and that she would not allow it. Carrow spat in McGonagall's face in retaliation, utterly enraging Harry who suddenly revealed himself while momentarily casting the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on the surprised Carrow. The curse sent Amycus flying backwards into the wall where he crumpled and fell unconscious. Harry then told McGonagall about the mission Dumbledore had left him, and she offered to hold Voldemort and his invading forces off, buying him the time he needed to search for the <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a>. All students of age, the D.A., and the members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> who had arrived to fight prepared themselves for the impending siege.

Harry realised that the positioning of Alecto Carrow in Ravenclaw Tower confirmed the Horcrux's identity. It was the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. After thinking on it for some seconds, he went to ask the <a href="/wiki/Helena_Ravenclaw" title="Helena Ravenclaw">Grey Lady</a> about the diadem. From her information, Harry surmised that the Horcrux had been hidden in the Room of Requirement. Harry, in the meantime, was worried about Hermione and Ron, who seemed to have disappeared.

<p>They fought their way to the <a href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a>. Along the way, Harry witnessed many scenes of horror. On the grounds, Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> were waiting. After having seen so much pain and death, Harry could not summon the happiness required to conjure a <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a>. In fact, Harry welcomed the oblivion that would come with the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a>.

</p><p>Once the trio arrived at the Shrieking Shack, they witnessed Voldemort order Nagini to kill Snape, as he believed that Snape was preventing him from being the true owner of the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>. Dumbledore was the previous owner of the wand, and as Snape killed him, Voldemort believes with Snape's demise, he will finally gain true mastery of the wand. Before he died, Snape gave Harry memories to view in the Pensieve and asked him to look into his eyes. Upon returning to the castle, Harry saw the corpses of <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a> near Fred's, and he felt devastated.

<p>During a one-hour ceasefire, Harry viewed the memories given by a dying Snape, which revealed to him that he had inadvertently been turned into a <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a> himself. This occurred when Voldemort attempted to murder him as a baby. Because Lily Potter's loving sacrifice made Voldemort's Killing Curse rebound and a fragment of his soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: Harry himself. This led to the awful truth being revelled, that Voldemort had to kill him in order to be rendered <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">mortal</a>. Harry was unwillingly tethering Voldemort to life.
</p><p>Harry also learned that Snape was, all along, with Dumbledore because he loved <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily Evans</a>, since before they started school. It was clear that Harry's life span had always been determined by how long it took to get rid of the Horcruxes, and that it was an elegant plan not to waste any more lives but to give the tasks to the boy who had already been marked for death, and whose death would not be tragic but simply another blow against <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a>. Heavy of heart, Harry courageously slipped off on his own to carry out this dreadful task. He felt ghostly as he strode through the castle's empty halls, feeling as if he was already dead.

<p>As Harry passed the <a href="/wiki/Great_Hall" title="Great Hall">Great Hall</a>, he could not see <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, or the other <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasleys</a>, nor <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna</a>. He felt he would have given anything for one last look at them, but then he thought he would never be able to stop looking. He also came to realise that Luna had become one of his closest and dearest friends. During his way to Voldemort, he saw the corpse of <a href="/wiki/Colin_Creevey" title="Colin Creevey">Colin Creevey</a>, who snuck back into the castle to fight despite being underage and remarked that Colin looked "tiny in death". Harry in a moments decision told <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville</a> to slay <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a>, if he could, as Ron and Hermione might be too busy to do so. He passed Ginny, who was comforting a small girl, and almost wished she could have seen him, but under the Invisibility cloak, this was impossible. As he passed Hagrid's hut on the Grounds, he emotionally remembered his trips there, particularly rock cakes, Ron vomiting slugs, and baby dragon <a href="/wiki/Norberta" title="Norberta">Norbert</a>.

Harry used it to speak to the spirits of his parents, <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, and Remus Lupin, who gave him comfort and courage before he met Voldemort and offered to shield him from the Dementors. They set off, and the Dementor's chill did not overcome him; his companions acted like Patronuses, and Harry continued deeper in the forest to find Voldemort. As Harry approached the Death Eater camp, he dropped the Resurrection Stone. Harry offered no resistance as Voldemort struck him with the Killing Curse. His last thoughts were of Ginny: her red hair, blazing looks, and the feel of her lips upon his before everything went black.

<p>However, the "death" he met was not permanent: the blood Voldemort had taken from Harry to restore his physical form in 1995 still contained the <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">Bond of Blood</a>, anchoring him to life and protecting Harry from Voldemort's curse, and his willingness to die triggered <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">protections</a> on the people of Hogwarts similar to the protections he received from his mother's sacrifice. Also, since he had part of Voldemort's soul in him, Voldemort's Killing Curse unknowingly destroyed the part of Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a>, leaving one Horcrux left. Harry entered a state of limbo, where he met the spirit of <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> and the piece of Voldemort's soul that had just been destroyed. Dumbledore explained everything to Harry saying that he had "<i>no more secrets from Harry</i>". After reconciling with his mentor, Harry made the choice to return to the physical world rather than go on to the afterlife with Dumbledore.

<p>Harry woke up, but feigned death. He was assisted in this by Narcissa Malfoy, who had secretly turned against Voldemort by telling him Harry was dead in order to protect her <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">son</a>, because she knew the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts was with the rest of the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> in their victory march.

<p>On 1 September, 2017 Harry and Ginny took their three children to <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Cross_Station" title="King&#39;s Cross Station">King's Cross Station</a> to see James and Albus off to Hogwarts.

When Albus expressed a fear that he might be Sorted into <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses" title="Hogwarts Houses">House</a>, Harry told his son that Albus was named after two Hogwarts Headmasters of whom one was a Slytherin and "<i>probably the bravest man</i> [he] <i>ever knew.</i>" Harry assured him that his parents would be proud of him regardless of where he was Sorted. He also told him that the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a> would take his preferences into consideration, which happened to him when he was being Sorted. This was a secret he had never shared with his other children.

<p>When Harry picked Albus up from <a href="/wiki/King%27s_Cross" class="mw-redirect" title="King&#39;s Cross">King's Cross</a>, who had returned from a year at Hogwarts, he was surprised to find Albus distant and colder. This distance was in direct response to the pressure Albus felt regarding Harry's legacy and the expectations that others put on him because of it. Albus and Scorpius Malfoy became fast friends during the year, as they were kindred spirits — they both carry a burden stemming from their family identity and feel that they are misfits and “losers” in comparison with the other students at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. Harry did not like this and he questioned why Albus was content to have only the one friend. Their relationship would stay strained for the next couple of years to come.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/September" title="September">September</a> <a href="/wiki/2018" title="2018">2018</a>, Harry took Albus to King's Cross again. He was hurt when Albus told him he wanted to be alone. This stemmed from all the pedestrians watching the two, Albus felt as though they were watching the famous Harry Potter and "his disappointing son". Harry told him not to be bothered by people looking and thought his friendship with <a href="/wiki/Scorpius_Malfoy" title="Scorpius Malfoy">Scorpius Malfoy</a>, the child of his rival, was the reason why Albus wanted nothing to do with him. Harry then demanded Albus sever their friendship, but his son refused.
</p><p>In September 2019, Harry took Albus to King's Cross yet again where he gave Albus the permission slip he needed to visit Hogsmeade. Albus destroyed the slip by burning it, stating that he had no wish to go to Hogsmeade and left his father behind. This in turn caused Harry to become angry with him. Their father-son relationship continues to deteriorate, going from bad to worse.
</p><p>By late summer of <a href="/wiki/2020" title="2020">2020</a>, Harry had been made Head of the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement">Department of Magical Law Enforcement</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-CC152_94-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CC152-94">&#91;94&#93;</a></sup> After hearing a rumour about an illegal and very powerful <a href="/wiki/Time-Turner" title="Time-Turner">Time-Turner</a>, Harry and his team of Aurors raid the Nott residence and confiscate it. The Time-Turner was supposedly made by Nott for Lucius Malfoy, who was paying him for his services. Harry turns over the Time-Turner to Hermione, the Minister for Magic, for safekeeping. While in his office, laden with paperwork he and Hermione spoke about recent activity among Voldemort's former allies and how action must be taken.

<p>Harry was later visited at home by <a href="/wiki/Amos_Diggory" title="Amos Diggory">Amos Diggory</a>, who had heard he might have the Time-Turner. Whom he supposedly learned this information from is unknown. While Albus and <a href="/wiki/Delphini" title="Delphini">Delphi Diggory</a> (who claimed to be Amos' carer and niece) listened in, Amos demanded Harry go back in time and save Cedric. Amos proceeded to tell Harry that Cedric was more then a spare and that he deserved a chance to life a full life. However, Harry refused due to the implications of intervening greatly with the past, as changing the past can have severe consequences on the future. This caused Amos to react negatively, calling Harry cold. Later that night Harry attempted to reconcile with Albus.
</p><p>Harry's relationship with Albus had strained increasingly since he had left for Hogwarts. In an effort to mend things, Harry spoke to Albus and tried to give him the old baby blanket he received from his mother <a href="/wiki/Lily" title="Lily">Lily</a>. He did this in the hope a reminder of what happened would make him change his behaviour. This was a significant and sentimental gift on Harry's part, as it was the only physical piece of his mother that he had. When Albus rejected the gift, it led to an argument in which they both expressed the wish that they were not related. Harry regretted what he said, but it was too late to take it back.

<p>Harry began to experience nightmares and pains in his scar, something that he had not experienced since his final defeat of Voldemort. Ginny tried to comfort him and proceeded to ask what was wrong. When Harry explained, they decided to let <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> know. Harry took his scar hurting to be an ominous sign and it left him with many worries concerning his son and the outcome of the future.
</p><p>He and Hermione held a public meeting, but the community was not convinced there is a threat, as they were not willing to accept that danger was once again imminent. Draco accused Harry of only wanting his name in the papers and proceeded to storm out of the public meeting. Later on Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a>, and Draco then learnt that Albus and Scorpius were missing. This prompted Draco to start a duel with Harry, Ginny was quick to interrupt it, before it got out of hand. They had decided to retrieve the Time-Turner and help Amos save Cedric. Ginny concluded Albus ran away after his argument with Harry, and <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco</a> was upset that Scorpius had been pulled into their family issues.

<p>Albus was brought to the school's hospital wing, where Harry conversed with a portrait of <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>. After Harry aired decades of pent-up emotion left over from the horrors of his childhood and Dumbledore reassuring him he did what he though was best for Harry's well being at the time, the portrait advised him to see Albus as he is. Harry demanded that Albus break off his association with Scorpius. He even went so far as to bully Headmistress <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> into using the <a href="/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" title="Marauder&#39;s Map">Marauder's Map</a> to keep them apart. This was something that he would not normally do. Harry's worry for his son had intensified so much that it blinded him to the bigger picture.
</p><p>When Albus and Scorpius went time travelling again, Harry and Ginny received a visit from Draco. He and Harry argued about their children, which resulted in a premature wizards' <a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">duel</a>. When Ginny intervened and reminded them their children were missing, Draco surprised them by explaining how lonely he was at Hogwarts and how lucky Harry was to have such great friendships.
</p><p>Harry and Draco finally gained a mutual respect for one another, and looked upon each other as friends. When Draco speaks of the great bond and sacrifices he has made for Scorpius and his late wife, Harry finally realised he was dangerously isolating Albus. They returned to Hogwarts, where Harry apologised to <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Professor McGonagall</a> and they attempted to locate the boys, ultimately discovering that they had the Time-Turner.
</p><p>However, in the other timeline, Albus and Scorpius had created a world where Harry had died at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>. Fortunately, with the help of the alternate Hermione, Ron and <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, Scorpius managed to salvage the original timeline and returned both Harry, and Albus to life. Harry visited Albus in his dormitory where despite his anger, he manages to plant the seed for a reconciliation with Albus.

<p>At home, Harry looked at the blanket he had tried to give Albus. He noticed writing on it, and found out it was a message sent by Albus from the past. He and Ginny noticed the date, being 30 October, 1981 — one day before the night that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> murdered Harry's parents. They alerted Ron and Hermione. Draco, who joined in, secretly revealed to them that his family had a Time-Turner that would be more potent and valuable than the one seized by the Ministry, which was merely a prototype and thus not as desirable to a true <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a>.

<p>They travelled back in time to join Albus and Scorpius. However, under Ginny's prodding, they realised that Delphi did not to want to kill baby Harry, but rather to stop Voldemort from doing so in the hope he would live and his reign would continue. Delphi thought she could make her father stronger as he would know love when he met her, which its lacking was what had originally led to his downfall.
</p><p>Everyone agreed they had to <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">transfigure</a> Harry to look like Voldemort in the hope that they could fool Delphi and hinder her in saving the real Voldemort. They picked Harry because he not only knew Voldemort well through the connection they shared when he was a Horcrux, but he now also understood Parseltongue again.
</p><p>Delphi pleaded with her "father" to recognise her, which Harry managed before the transfiguration spell came undone. However, when Delphi sees she had been set up, she engaged in a fierce duel with Harry, who is later joined by his friends and Albus. They managed to subdue her and she pleaded that she only wants to know her father. A surprised Harry explained that this would not be possible; they cannot change the past.
</p><p>Upon hearing the real Voldemort arrive to kill Harry's parents, Delphi tried calling out to him, but Hermione and Malfoy silenced her and sent her back to present day. Harry decided to watch the scene of his parents' murder once more, with Albus by his side, to provide a sense of closure for them. They later returned to the present when a devastated <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> arrived at the scene to bring Harry to the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursleys</a>.

<p>Harry was a near-spitting image of <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_(disambiguation)" title="James Potter (disambiguation)">his father</a>, having inherited his untidy jet-black hair. However, his almond-shaped startlingly green eyes were identical to those of <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">his mother</a>. This strong resemblece was often remarked on by those who had known his parents.  
</p><p>Harry's physique as a boy was described as "small and skinny", with a thin face and knobbly knees. This skinniness was due to his poor quality of life in his childhood. Despite the neglect he suffered, Harry seems to have grown at the same rate as James. When he was fifteen he was within an inch of <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> at the same age, and when he was seventeen he was exactly the same height his father was, and James was often described as tall. Harry was so much like his father that Harry mistook his future self for him while saving Sirius’s life from the Dementors, although his father was then dead. 
</p><p>Harry wore round-rimmed glasses, peculiarly similar to his father's glasses. During his time hunting Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux-making_spell" title="Horcrux-making spell">Horcruxes</a>, Harry's black hair grew shoulder length as was described when he saw his reflection in <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a>. This was due to his preoccupation with the hunt for the Horcruxes and his lack of interest in his physical appearance, it is the longest his hair has ever been.

<p>Harry was an extremely brave, loyal, and selfless person who possessed tremendous strength of character. He willingly went to what he truly believed to be his death, because he believed that this was the only way to defeat the Dark Lord. Harry was also marked by what <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> once deemed a "<i>weakness for heroics</i>" — he would go to great lengths and take great risks in order to help others, particularly his loved ones. Notably, this was taken advantage of by Voldemort in 1996, when he lured Harry to the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a> by making him believe that his <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">godfather</a> was in danger.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP32_96-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP32-96">&#91;96&#93;</a></sup> Harry was also very strong-willed and unafraid to stand up for himself.

<p>Harry was perfectly prepared to put his friends' needs and best interests first, shown by how he ended his relationship with <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, due to his concern for her well being (even though being with her was one of the best things that ever happened to him).<sup id="cite_ref-HBP30_99-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP30-99">&#91;99&#93;</a></sup> The amount of trust that Harry put into his friends was so strong that he absolutely refused to consider that any of them would betray him to Voldemort.

This can also happen if a loved one of his is, even if it isn't true, insulted in front of him, as he so enraged he was seriously considering attacking <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> himself when he stated he believed Sirius was wrong to have treated Kreacher the way he did and that he was trying to keep Sirius alive by keeping him in 12 Grimmauld Place, as Harry believed that Dumbledore had no right, despite knowing fully well he was completely outmatched by Dumbledore, who he acknowledged to be the greatest wizard in history, but fortunately for Harry Dumbledore did not resort to such means and calmly levelled with him.

<p>However, Harry was also accused of being arrogant, in particular by Severus Snape (although Snape's perspective was skewed due to his poor relationship with James Potter, and Harry often found being famous and admired very difficult), and could be hot-tempered and impulsive.

<p>Harry was prone to moodiness and unkind remarks towards even his friends during his adolescence, though this is likely the result of the great emotional stress and trials he endured during this period. Harry displayed many signs of clinical depression throughout his mid-to-late teens, however this extended to his older life. In his mid-to-late teens, Harry showed signs of these symptoms: general discontent, guilt, hopelessness, mood swings, insomnia (nightmares), agitation, irritability, social isolation and even lack of concentration. These symptoms were continued to be well into his mid ages. It was clear that Harry received limited assistance in his depression during his adolescence, although this was possibly improved in his later life.
</p><p>Harry was also not one to let bygones be bygones. He had a vindictive streak that made him vengeful at best and spiteful at worse towards those who did him wrong. This varied from wanting to murder/torture those who had performed unforgivable acts like: Bellatrix, Voldemort, and <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> to a desire for pettiness towards: <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, Draco Malfoy, Snape, and the Dursley's. Harry even wanted Sirius (before learning of his innocence) and Pettigrew to suffer the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_kiss" class="mw-redirect" title="Dementor&#39;s kiss">Dementor's kiss</a> for their crimes and spent the entirety of the Horcrux hunt angry at Dumbledore for the latter's lack of trust.

<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>Harry possessed an instinctual, intuitive intelligence. This intelligence allowed him to make intellectual leaps,  as opposed to the logical intelligence of Hermione. For example, Harry divined the truth about the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a> well before Hermione would accept it.<sup id="cite_ref-DH22_101-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH22-101">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup> And although he was clever, Harry lacked intellectual curiosity. He rarely put forth effort into school work; for instance, he relied on the notes of the <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Half-Blood Prince</a> to get ahead in his sixth year <a href="/wiki/Potions_(class)" title="Potions (class)">Potions</a> class rather than devoting time to studying.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_102-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-102">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup> Although he did study reasonably hard for his <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_Wizarding_Level" title="Ordinary Wizarding Level">Ordinary Wizarding Levels</a>, the only set of wizarding qualifications he sat at Hogwarts. Harry generally did his best magical work when tackling practical exams rather than theoretical ones. This could be a result of the lack of confidence that Harry developed from growing up with the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursleys</a>.
</p><p>Barty Crouch Jnr (disguised as Alastor Moody) remarked that Harry possessed a streak of pride and independence that almost cost him the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>. His pride didn't allow him to ask for help regarding the problem of breathing underwater for an hour, which was required for the Second task that took place in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lake" title="Great Lake">Black Lake</a>, was what almost cost him the competition.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF34_97-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF34-97">&#91;97&#93;</a></sup> Harry was also known for wanting to tackle challenges and obstacles on his own, without the aid or interference of others. His friends had to frequently remind him that he needed their assistance and that he "<i>did not always have to go it alone</i>".
</p><p>Harry also seemed to have a bit of an obsessive personality, a trait he shared with his arch enemy Lord Voldemort. He could be somewhat nosy and was known for sleuthing around and getting involved in things that did not concern him. For instance, during his sixth year Harry became intensely preoccupied with finding out what Malfoy was doing in his free time.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_102-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-102">&#91;102&#93;</a></sup> He also developed on unhealthy obsession with the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a>, to the point where he was listless with longing for the three artefacts. This period of listlessness lasted for many weeks during the hunt for Lord Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>.

<p>Harry's greatest strength was his ability to feel love, despite having a miserable childhood of neglect. Harry was extremely loyal to and protective of his loved ones and that love was what allowed him to overcome Voldemort. Dumbledore noted that Harry's strength of will at resisting the temptation of the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a>, even when granted a direct insight into Voldemort's mind and methods was due to Harry's ability to love. Harry even claimed that he felt sorry for Voldemort because of his inability to feel or understand love. Ginny, his wife, commented that he was the kindest and most loving man anyone would ever meet.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP23_103-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP23-103">&#91;103&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Albus Dumbledore noted that Harry was unfailingly kind and compassionate. This is shown by how he freed <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> from the Malfoys and by standing up for <a href="/wiki/Muggle-borns" class="mw-redirect" title="Muggle-borns">Muggle-borns</a>, <a href="/wiki/Half-blood" title="Half-blood">half-bloods</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Half-breeds" class="mw-redirect" title="Half-breeds">half-breeds</a> (like Hagrid). This is likely attributable to his childhood, during which the Dursleys deprived him of compassion and discriminated against him due to his <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> abilities. His compassionate led him to spare the life of <a href="/wiki/Delphini" title="Delphini">Delphi</a>, the daughter of Lord Voldemort, despite the history between himself and the Dark Lord. Also, Harry was not a cruel person and he never wished anyone harm. He rarely initiated duels, instead fighting in self-defence. Even after Bellatrix Lestrange had murdered his godfather, Harry failed to cast the Cruciatus Curse on her. Bellatrix noted the he had failed to cast the curse properly because he had cast it out of righteous anger and not malicious intent.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP36_100-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP36-100">&#91;100&#93;</a></sup> However, he did use the Cruciatus Curse more effectively on <a href="/wiki/Amycus_Carrow" title="Amycus Carrow">Amycus Carrow</a> after he spat at and insulted <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>. In addition, he saved Peter Pettigrew from being killed by his (Pettigrew's) former friends Sirius Black and Remus Lupin, though this was not done for humanitarian reasons but for the memory of his father.
</p><p>Remus Lupin once noted that Harry had very good and nearly always right instincts.<sup id="cite_ref-DH22_101-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH22-101">&#91;101&#93;</a></sup> Harry had a strong awareness of the incalculable power of certain acts, which is never more apparent than when he refused to allow Lupin to accompany him and leave his wife and child at home and realised that Ron Weasley was meant to destroy <a href="/wiki/Slytherin%27s_locket" class="mw-redirect" title="Slytherin&#39;s locket">Slytherin's locket</a>.

<p>In some ways, Harry can become extremely intimidating toward people such as: <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" title="Gilderoy Lockhart">Gilderoy Lockhart</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mundungus_Fletcher" title="Mundungus Fletcher">Mundungus Fletcher</a>, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley. It is seen that Harry can become extremely frightening when pushed to the point of anger or extreme annoyance. When in a bad mood and argumentative, even Harry's closest friends have been shown to be wary of him, usually replying to his angry tone in a calm and appeasing voice. The only person who does not appear to be afraid of him when he is angry (other than his teachers and other authority figures in his life) is Ginny Weasley. Dumbledore is a special case, as he acts fatherly towards Harry and has managed to successfully calm him down whenever he got angry with him.
</p><p>Harry seems to have good and long memory, as he remembers the motorbike ride to Privet Drive with Hagrid when he was eleven and could remember the deaths of his mother and Voldemort's laughter when the events occurred ten years earlier.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_49-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-49">&#91;49&#93;</a></sup> Despite needing glasses, Harry possessed a tremendous eyesight as well, he was able to locate the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Snitch" title="Golden Snitch">Golden Snitch</a> (which was approximately the size of a golf ball) in a massive Quidditch field. Harry also cared very much for his children. He comforted his daughter, <a href="/wiki/Lily_L._Potter" title="Lily L.

<p>Although never as given to sarcasm or humour as his best friend Ron, Harry often displayed a dry wit. For instance, on finding out that <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> intended to take twelve O.W.Ls, he asked her if she planned to eat or sleep at all that year. This humour often became more cutting when applied to people Harry disliked.

</p><p>He was also known to apply his cutting wit to Severus Snape and Dudley Dursley as well. During his first Potions lesson, Snape antagonised Harry with question after question.

When Harry was eleven, <a href="/wiki/Dudley" title="Dudley">Dudley</a> suggested that he and Harry should do upstairs and practise shoving heads down toilets. Harry then stated that the toilet had never had something as disgusting as Dudley's head down it.

<p>Although he never sought power himself and would be content with a normal life, when a situation required him to step up he would do so. Such as when he, Ron, and Hermione discovered Voldemort and Quirrell's attempt to steal the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a> and his time as teacher/leader of <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>. Harry has shown not-inconsiderable leadership abilities, to the point that Dumbledore reflected that Harry was a better leader than him as he never sought power for himself but simply had to assume the mantle of leadership due to circumstances beyond his control and found in the process that he did it well.
</p><p>During his youth, Harry tended to see things in a rather stark, absolute manner, particularly when it came to the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses" title="Hogwarts Houses">Hogwarts Houses</a>. Harry generally regarded members of <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin House</a> as evil and therefore his enemies, while <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindors</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuffs</a> were allies. The former part could be due to his own status as a Gryffindor and that many of the Slytherins he encountered, such as Lord Voldemort, Draco Malfoy, and Severus Snape, were significant enemies of his during this period. In addition, many of his friends and allies, such as: Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and Hagrid, were fellow Gryffindors. However, this mentality eroded as he aged, since he encountered both allies among Slytherin, such as <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> (and later, Snape) and enemies among the other three Houses, such as Peter Pettigrew (a fellow Gryffindor) and <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> (a Ravenclaw). By 2017, Harry had adopted a more moderate attitude on the Houses, telling his younger son Albus Potter that "<i>it doesn't matter to us</i>" if Albus was Sorted in Slytherin or Gryffindor. In addition, Harry named that same son after <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, whom he recounted as "<i>the bravest man</i> [he] <i>ever knew</i>".
</p><p>In the aftermath of the Secondary Wizarding War, Harry is shown to suffer from survivors guilt and also Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. These two symptoms extend into his childhood and throughout his life at Hogwarts. Because of his depression he also claims that he was supposed to die and everyone knew it, but he survived it all. He also claims that too many people died for the "Boy Who Lived" and that he wasn't worth dying for at all. Harry's depression and trauma are caused by not having removed Voldemort completely from his life. He fears that he will always allow Voldemort to have some mental and emotional control over him. 
</p><p>Harry also has shown signs of suffering from recurring clinical depression, such as his sullen and withdrawn demeanour during his mid-to-late teens as a result of the tragedies in his life. A particular symptom of this is his outrageous temper during his bouts of depression, which frighten all but Ginny by their sheer force and magnitude alone. Overall, Harry is much the same as any other soldier, struggling to carry on despite the horrors of his past and the brutality he has been a part of for so long. 
</p><p>Harry does have some fears, though he hides them extremely well from his family. In fact he hide them so well that his younger son considered his father to be utterly fearless. These fears include the dark, pigeons, small spaces, and seeing his family in danger. 
</p><p>It is commented by his son that Harry's personality is complicated and this is furthered by Ron, who calls him intense in terms of his traits and past experiences.<sup id="cite_ref-CC415_105-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CC415-105">&#91;105&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Harry was seen and had proven himself to be an extremely powerful and talented wizard.

</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">Love</a></b>: Harry's greatest power of all was his ability to love. In spite of being raised by a family that treated him with anything but affection, Harry remarkably turned out capable of very strong love. For example, Harry's love for his friends caused him to sacrifice himself to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>. This loving sacrifice conferred a certain amount of <a href="/wiki/Sacrificial_protection" title="Sacrificial protection">protection</a> onto his allies, making it so that <a href="/wiki/Spell" title="Spell">spells</a> Voldemort tried to place on them quickly wore off.<sup id="cite_ref-DH36_107-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH36-107">&#91;107&#93;</a></sup> Harry's ability to love has also protected and helped him on several occasions. Those occasions are: when he produced a Patronus that could drive hundreds of <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> away,<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108">&#91;108&#93;</a></sup> repelled Voldemort when he possessed him,<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP36_100-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP36-100">&#91;100&#93;</a></sup> and the times he was able to close the connection between himself and Voldemort.<sup id="cite_ref-DH24_109-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH24-109">&#91;109&#93;</a></sup> His love was strongest when directed at <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, who was the driving force that kept him going until Voldemort was defeated. Harry also felt strong love toward his three children, such as when he deliberately placed himself between his son <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>.

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">Flying</a></b>: Harry had inherited his <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">father</a>'s talent for flying and for <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a>. Harry showed immediate command of a <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a> in his first year, which made him a naturally good <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">Seeker</a>. This was the first magical skill for which he discovered an aptitude, as he found in 1991. In fact, at the mere age of eleven, Harry became the youngest Seeker in a century.<sup id="cite_ref-PS9_125-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS9-125">&#91;125&#93;</a></sup> As a Seeker, Harry was capable of surpassing even far more experienced Seekers, near-always winning the Quidditch matches for Gryffindor, and was considered to be even better than <a href="/wiki/Charles_Weasley" title="Charles Weasley">Charlie Weasley</a>, with the only time he ever lost to <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> being due to the presence of <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a>. <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> noted that Harry's Quidditch skills were equal to his father's own. His extraordinary flying skills also aided him when pursuing the <a href="/wiki/Winged_Keys" title="Winged Keys">Winged Keys</a> enchanted by <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Professor Flitwick</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone_Chambers" class="mw-redirect" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone Chambers">Philosopher's Stone Chambers</a>, with him being the primary leader of the trio's chase of the Keys and the one who noticed and captured the Key needed to unlock the door. It also helped him in the Triwizard Tournament (where he had to steal a golden egg from a <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_Horntail" title="Hungarian Horntail">Hungarian Horntail</a>), managing to successfully irritate the dragon into chasing him by dodging all her flame attacks and then outrace her into the egg, a display that highly impressed all of the witnesses and earned him the first place among the Triwizard Champions. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> he also managed to escape a <a href="/wiki/Fiendfyre" title="Fiendfyre">Fiendfyre</a> inferno in the <a href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">Room of Requirement</a>, via broomstick.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parseltongue</a></b>: Because he carried <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">a piece of Voldemort's soul</a> within himself, Harry was able to speak and understand Parseltongue from <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a> to <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>. After that soul fragment was destroyed, Harry seemingly lost this ability.

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Mind-reading" title="Mind-reading">Insight into Voldemort's mind</a></b>: Also due to the piece of Voldemort's soul, Harry was able to look into Voldemort's mind and see through his senses from time to time. He sometimes used this ability to monitor what <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> was doing. However, it was a dangerous ability to have as well; Voldemort once used it, along with <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a>, to plant a false vision in Harry's mind of <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> being tortured, which he used to lure Harry to the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP23_126-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP23-126">&#91;126&#93;</a></sup> Additionally, because of their connection, Harry felt a burning pain in his scar whenever he and Voldemort were in close proximity or whenever Voldemort felt strong negative emotions. Harry lost this ability as well when the soul fragment within him was destroyed. Harry also possessed a non-magical insight into Voldemort's mind from the information Dumbledore shared with him during their lessons. This insight allowed Harry to figure out that a <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a> was stored at <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts Wizarding Bank</a> after which Ron and Hermoine noted Harry's understanding of Voldemort causing to Harry admit that he did understand parts of Voldemort.</li>

<ul><li><b>Leadership skills</b>: While Harry never deliberately set out to be a leader to others, he had often taken charge when the situation required it.

Dumbledore had deliberately sought power in his youth, and subsequently avoided anything more demanding than his role as <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> headmaster — while Harry had leadership thrust upon. Harry accepted the burden of command, acknowledging his responsibilities towards those who "followed" him.

<li><b>Indomitable willpower</b>: Harry appeared to possess an unbreakable spirit and though not above depression, he never truly gave up on any mission.

It has been a very popular name in the English-speaking world for centuries. Harry can also be a diminutive form of the name Harold, from the Old English name <i>Hereweald</i>, meaning "leader of the army".

The name came into English language from the French variation of the Late Latin name Iacomus, a dialect variant of Iacobus, from the New Testament Greek Ἰάκωβος (Iakōbos), from Hebrew word יעקב (Yaʻaqov). James is Harry's middle name, James was the name of his father and is also the name of his first son.

By the time <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i> was released, Radcliffe had played the role for ten years consecutively.
<ul><li>The first actor to be cast as Harry was actually American actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?q=nm0014582" class="extiw" title="imdb:nm0014582">Liam Aiken</a>, but he lost the part the next day, allegedly because he wasn't British.</li></ul></li>

<li>Both Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Emma Watson (<a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>) speak in Modernised Received Pronunciation, an accent associated with prestige and wealth, but in the story, most characters that speak in RP are <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-bloods</a>.</li>
<li>Interestingly, Harry and Ginny share the same star sign: Leo, also the sign of their house, Gryffindor. <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Daniel_Radcliffe" title="Daniel Radcliffe">Daniel Radcliffe</a>, too, share the same star sign.</li>
<li>Harry's first friends were Rubeus Hagrid and Ronald Weasley. Interestingly, both had names that start with the letter "R".</li>
<li>Several undisclosed theories suggest that, as per the prophecy, Voldemort was the only one capable of killing Harry. Meaning that, with Voldemort dead, Harry cannot be killed, though he can presumably still die of natural causes. Still, in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child" title="Harry Potter and the Cursed Child">Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</a></i>, Harry was killed by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> in an alternate universe.</li>
<li>Several times throughout Cursed Child, Harry has been called "savior of the wizarding world", it is unknown whether this is a given title or an alias that has been given to Harry in his older age. Although, this places Harry higher in respect than Dumbledore, in his defeat of an internationally wanted wizard.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Daniel_Radcliffe" title="Daniel Radcliffe">Daniel Radcliffe</a> never provided voice-acting for any of the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_video_games" title="Harry Potter video games"><i>Harry Potter</i> video games</a>.

<li>In the whole <i>Harry Potter</i> series, Harry has only called Draco Malfoy by just his first name two times.
<ul><li>The first time was when they were in detention in the Forbidden Forest in their first year.</li>
<li>The second and last time he called Draco Malfoy by his first name was during the final duel with Voldemort in the Great Hall, when Harry talked about the mastery of the Elder wand. He said that Voldemort wasn't the master of the Elder Wand, Draco was.</li></ul></li>
<li>Harry is right-handed. He tells this to Mr Ollivander in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i>. He is also seen writing with this hand throughout the film series.</li>
<li>Despite Harry's birthday being on July 31st in the books, it seems that in the first film it was moved to August 31st, because Hagrid first met Harry in the <a href="/wiki/Hut-on-the-Rock" title="Hut-on-the-Rock">shack</a> on the day of Harry's birthday, then he took Harry to Diagon Alley and then to King's Cross the next day, where Harry took the Hogwarts Express.</li>
<li>He often describes various parts of his anatomy as feeling like <a href="/wiki/Lead" title="Lead">lead</a>.</li>
<li>In the films, Harry is shown to wear the colour blue in nearly all his clothing. It could possibly connect with the symbolic meanings of the colour to be that of; trust, wisdom, loyalty, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth and heaven. These particular attributes are significantly linked to Harry's personality throughout the series.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Josh_Herdman" title="Josh Herdman">Josh Herdman</a> plays Harry when he is disguised as <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Goyle" title="Gregory Goyle">Gregory Goyle</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">Chamber of Secrets</a>,</i> as does <a href="/wiki/David_O%27Hara" title="David O&#39;Hara">David O'Hara</a> when he is disguised as <a href="/wiki/Albert_Runcorn" title="Albert Runcorn">Albert Runcorn</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>.

<li>In a deleted scene of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>, when he is disguised as <a href="/wiki/Albert_Runcorn" title="Albert Runcorn">Albert Runcorn</a>, Harry calls <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> by his first name. This is the only time Harry does this.</li>
<li>Daniel Radcliffe and Harry were both born in July — Harry on the 31st and Daniel on the 23rd.</li>
<li>Harry has green eyes, but in the films he has blue eyes. This is due to the fact that Daniel Radcliffe was allergic to the contact lenses. Radcliffe also has brown hair, as opposed to Harry's black hair, and also has a strong physical body, rather than the slim frame Harry is described as having. However Harry is only described as having an uncommonly 'slim' frame in the earlier instalments, so it is possible that he bulked out a little into a lean frame as he matured.</li>
<li>Harry's birthday of 31 July is also the birthday of <i>Harry Potter</i> author, <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>, and actor <a href="/wiki/Richard_Griffiths" title="Richard Griffiths">Richard Griffiths</a> who played Harry's Uncle <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon Dursley</a> in the Harry Potter films.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Mirror_of_Erised" title="Mirror of Erised">Mirror of Erised</a>, Harry saw his family, a lot of people with untidy black hair, his own noses, mouths and knees. However, he also saw some people with almond-shaped green eyes, which could indicate that he saw his <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> family as well, even though he did not see the <a href="/wiki/Dursley_family" title="Dursley family">Dursley family</a>.</li></ul>

<ul><li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, Harry is seen practising <a href="/wiki/Lumos_Maxima" title="Lumos Maxima">Lumos Maxima</a> under the covers in his bedroom, but Harry does not get a letter from the <a href="/wiki/Improper_Use_of_Magic_Office" title="Improper Use of Magic Office">Improper Use of Magic Office</a> even though he is under-age, however, judging by the book he is reading, his reason for doing so is most likely for homework. In the book he is simply using a torch while writing his homework for <a href="/wiki/History_of_Magic" title="History of Magic">History of Magic</a>.</li>
<li>While Harry repeatedly states <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> is the best student in his year in all classes, he has beaten her in two of the three Defence Against the Dark Arts exams they had together, with Hermione only beating him in their first year exam. In addition, <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> has said that Harry could have beaten Hermione in a magical duel halfway through <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">&#91;163&#93;</a></sup> Part of this can be put down to <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Professor Lupin</a>'s way of teaching, which preferred practical lessons over theory, as it seemed to help bring out Harry's own talent at the subject. It is probably more accurate to say that Hermione is the best student in every subject but DADA, in which Harry is strongest; hence, in Harry's mind she is the best student overall.</li>
<li>Harry's niece and nephew, <a href="/wiki/Rose_Granger-Weasley" title="Rose Granger-Weasley">Rose</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Granger-Weasley" title="Hugo Granger-Weasley">Hugo</a>, have some of the same heritage of Harry. A <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> mother, <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, and a <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-blood</a> father, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>. This makes Rose, Hugo and Harry all half-bloods.</li>
<li>Throughout the films, Harry's hair grows longer and longer (the longest point was in <i>Goblet of Fire</i>) until it was cut for <i>Order of the Phoenix</i>. It has since grown to about the same length as it was for <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i>.</li>
<li>In the films, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_scars" title="Harry Potter&#39;s scars">Harry's scar</a> is off-centre on his forehead; this was apparently done at <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>'s request: because of the books' artwork, many fans believe the scar is in the centre of his head. But it is never explicitly mentioned where the scar is located. On all the U.S. book covers (illustrations), the scar on Harry's forehead is located in the centre. The same is definitely true of the last two U.K. instalments; however, on early U.K. book covers, Harry's scar tends to appear slightly off-centre. It is somewhat hard to tell on most of these covers, as Harry's face is only visible in profile. However, on the U.K. cover of Chamber of Secrets, Harry's scar is decidedly off-centre. It is perhaps of this book that Rowling was thinking.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Marauders" title="Marauders">Marauders</a> believed they discovered more secret places than anyone else in the history of <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. This is not necessarily true, as unlike Harry and <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a>, they did not discover the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">Room of Requirement</a>. However, as they discovered an untold number of secret passages and hidden rooms, they did discover more numerous secrets than Riddle or Harry, just not the same ones.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry,_A_History:_The_True_Story_of_a_Boy_Wizard,_His_Fans,_and_Life_Inside_the_Harry_Potter_Phenomenon" title="Harry, A History: The True Story of a Boy Wizard, His Fans, and Life Inside the Harry Potter Phenomenon">Harry, A History</a></i>, Rowling discussed how <a href="/wiki/Steve_Kloves" title="Steve Kloves">Steve Kloves</a> suspected that something might happen between Harry and Hermione in <i>Deathly Hallows</i>. She replied: "I had always planned that Harry's true soul mate, which I stand by, is Ginny, and that Ron and Hermione have this combative but mutual attraction. They will always bicker, there will always be rough edges there, but they are pulled together, each has something the other needs. [Kloves] felt a certain pull between them at that point. And I think he's right. There are moments when Harry and Hermione touch, which are charged moments. One when she touches his hair as he sits on the hilltop reading about Dumbledore and Grindelwald, and two the moment when they walk out of the graveyard with their arms around each other. Now the fact is that Hermione shares moments with Harry that Ron will never be able to participate in. He walked out. She shared something very intense with Harry. So I think it could have gone that way".<sup id="cite_ref-HAH_164-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HAH-164">&#91;164&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>In a interview Rowling says when Harry faced Voldemort in the forest and didn't defend himself that she never saw like a scientific equation and that Harry wasn't guaranteed to survive,  there has to be space, to make Harry truly heroic, for free will. It has to be his choice. The whole thing's his choice. He chooses to sacrifice himself just as Lily chose to sacrifice herself. He chooses to pull himself back to life, and that's his own will and courage. So ultimately, those things, all of them were more important than the magic.<sup id="cite_ref-Pottercast_87-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pottercast-87">&#91;87&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The only person Harry ever considered killing by use of curse was <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> and possibly <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>, ironically to avenge Sirius. It is, however, unclear if Harry knew how to cast the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Avada Kedavra</a> curse since he was not taught the <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curses</a> until his fourth year. Furthermore, when Harry found out that <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> was the one who had betrayed his parents to Voldemort, he did not want Sirius and <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> to kill Pettigrew in revenge. Even during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, in which Harry defeated <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, Harry did not do so by use of any curse intended to do harm to his opponent, but rather he used his "trademark", <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Expelliarmus</a>. Harry finished Voldemort by reflecting a curse Harry would never use on another, even his mortal enemy. This suggests the <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a>, which is "the power the Dark Lord knows not..." makes it difficult for Harry to kill. Even during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Seven_Potters" title="Battle of the Seven Potters">Battle of the Seven Potters</a>, Harry illustrated his unwillingness to kill <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. During that battle the Death Eaters were masked at the time, he could not know who was a willing follower and who was a controlled drone. However in the example with Voldemort, Harry knew Voldemort's <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a> would backfire, so rather than use the same curse which would make him look somewhat bad, he instead decided to use the <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Disarming Charm</a> to gain possession of the wand.</li>
<li>Harry usually has the last line in every <i>Harry Potter</i> film. Though it could be debatable on whether he has the last line of the second film since the closed captions say that Dean said, "Yes!", so he may have had the last line.

<ul><li>Harry Potter and <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>'s romantic relationship is told in a different way in the films series from the novel versions of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i>:
<ul><li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">novel version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a>,  Harry shares his first kiss with Ginny in front of <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> students in the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Tower" title="Gryffindor Tower">Gryffindor Common Room</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team" title="Gryffindor Quidditch team">Gryffindor Quidditch team</a> won the Quidditch Cup. He also breaks it off with her at Dumbledore's funeral.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a>, In the boy's dorms, Harry and Ron talk about Ginny snogging <a href="/wiki/Dean_Thomas" title="Dean Thomas">Dean Thomas</a>. Harry tells Ron that Ginny is "smart, funny, attractive". Ron doesn't understand that Harry has got feelings for Ginny, and Harry tries to hide his feelings for Ginny from Ron so that he doesn't ruin their friendship. Harry and Ginny go to the Room of Requirement together to hide Harry's copy of the Advanced Potion-Making book, which previously belong to the <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Half-Blood Prince</a>, after he hurts <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>. While there Ginny asked Harry to close his eyes while she goes and hides the Half-Blood Prince book so that he and other students can not find it, when she returned to him, Ginny kisses Harry. Harry was very much delighted and surprised that he received a kiss from her. It is implied that they are still dating at the end of the film.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">novel version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a>, Harry and Ginny kiss on Harry's seventeenth birthday in Ginny's bedroom at <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">the Burrow</a>, and Ron interrupts them when he opens the door.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">film version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part One</a>, Harry was in the kitchen at the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley family</a> home, on the day of the <a href="/wiki/Wedding_of_William_Weasley_and_Fleur_Delacour" title="Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour">wedding</a> of <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a>.

Harry and Ginny talked and shared a kiss, while they were kissing Ginny's brother <a href="/wiki/George_Weasley" title="George Weasley">George Weasley</a> comes into the room and interrupts them.</li></ul></li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2</a></i>, Ginny and Neville are both climbing up on one of the staircases, and run into Harry during the battle. Neville ask Harry if he has seen <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>, then he confesses to Ginny and Harry that he as feelings for Luna, he went away to find and tell her. Harry and Ginny share a quick kiss, Harry was going to tell Ginny that he loved her, but Ginny quickly told him that she knows, and they both went back to what they were doing before they met up. This did not happen in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i> book.</li>
<li>A running gag in the books is the messiness of Harry's hair. In the films, this is not mentioned except for a reference in the fourth film. Harry notices that Hagrid has combed his hair so he will look good for <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Olympe Maxime</a>. When Harry says to him, <i>"Hagrid, have you combed your hair?!"</i> Hagrid states, <i>"As a matter of fact, I have. You might wanna try the same thing now and again".</i></li>
<li>Harry Potter is still the only wizard to this day that has had all three <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curses</a> cast on him and survived.
<ul><li>He also used two out of the three: the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>. The only one he never used was the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>, which on the contrary is his nemesis' favourite spell.</li></ul></li>
<li>Despite Remus Lupin suggested him not to let the <i><a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Expelliarmus</a></i> become his signature spell, this was the very spell which Harry used in his last duel against Voldemort.</li>
<li>The first spell casted on Harry, <i><a href="/wiki/Mending_Charm" title="Mending Charm">Reparo</a></i>, used by Hermione Granger on the Hogwarts Express during their first encounter, is also the last spell used by Harry in the novels.</li>
<li>Both <a href="/wiki/Michael_Corner" title="Michael Corner">Michael Corner</a> and Harry have dated the same girls, but in a different order, Cho Chang and Ginny Weasley.</li>
<li>Despite being a talented Quidditch player (and the team Seeker, considered the most important player on the team), Harry never played a full season (every minute of all three matches):
<ul><li>In his first year, he was recuperating in the hospital wing after saving the Philosopher's Stone, and thus missed the final match.</li>
<li>In his second year, the final match of the season was cancelled due to the attack on Hermione and <a href="/wiki/Penelope_Clearwater" title="Penelope Clearwater">Penelope Clearwater</a>.</li>
<li>In his third year, Harry came closest to playing a full season, but spent the last few seconds of the opening Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff match unconscious after being attacked by Dementors.</li>
<li>In his fourth year, the Quidditch Cup was cancelled due to the Triwizard Tournament.</li>
<li>In his fifth year, Harry was banned by Dolores Umbridge after the opening Gryffindor vs. Slytherin match.</li>
<li>In his sixth year, Harry was knocked unconscious partway through the second match of the season against Hufflepuff, and then held in detention for the final match against Ravenclaw.</li>
<li>In what would have been his seventh year, he didn't attend Hogwarts due to his quest to destroy the Horcruxes.</li></ul></li></ul>

<li>Harry Potter is J. K. Rowling's favourite character, though she feels that she is unusual in this, as she finds that Ron is generally more popular.<sup class="noprint">&#91;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs references to reliable sources." style="white-space: nowrap;">citation needed</span></i></a>&#93;</sup></li>
<li>A rumour circulating on the Internet stated that early drafts of the second half of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i> included a scene in which Harry lost his virginity, but that this scene was cut to avoid complaints from parents. J. K. Rowling confirmed that this rumour was false, however,<sup id="cite_ref-170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-170">&#91;170&#93;</a></sup> later further clarifying that she "never wrote it, never announced it, and never edited it out".<sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-171">&#91;171&#93;</a></sup></li>

<li>Just like his best friend Ron Weasley, Harry got a Muggle driving licence and bought himself a car, but it was never said if they got the Licence to Apparate (although, both of them having been Aurors, most likely they did).</li></ul>

<ul><li>"<i>The plan was, which I really hope I fulfilled, is that the reader, like Harry, would gradually discover Ginny as pretty much the ideal girl for Harry. She's tough, not in an unpleasant way, but she's gutsy. He needs to be with someone who can stand the demands of being with Harry Potter, because he's a scary boyfriend in a lot of ways. He's a marked man. I think she's funny, and I think that she's very warm and compassionate. These are all things that Harry requires in his ideal woman. But, I felt — and I'm talking years ago when all this was planned — initially, she's terrified by his image. I mean, he's a bit of a rock god to her when she sees him first, at 10 or 11, and he's this famous boy. So Ginny had to go through a journey as well… I feel that Ginny and Harry, in this book, they are total equals. They are worthy of each other. They've both gone through a big emotional journey, and they've really got over a lot of delusions, to use your word, together. So, I enjoyed writing that.</i>"<sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">&#91;172&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>"<i>Harry and Ginny are real soul mates. They’re both very strong and very passionate. That’s their connection, and they’re remarkable together.</i>"</li>
<li>"<i>Ginny and Harry really are soulmates. I think she’s like Harry. She’s got an intellectual curiosity and she’s got something of belief.</i>"</li>
<li>"<i>Harry and Ginny were always meant to be together. I thought it was obvious, but apparently there were internet wars about this.</i>"</li>
<li>"<i>Harry's love for Ginny is true.</i>"</li>
<li>"<i>It was not an arbitrary decision: holly has certain connotations that were perfect for Harry, particularly when contrasted with the traditional associations of yew, from which <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_wand" title="Tom Riddle&#39;s wand">Voldemort’s wand</a> is made. European tradition has it that the holly tree (the name comes from ‘holy’) repels evil, while yew, which can achieve astonishing longevity (there are British yew trees over two thousand years old), can symbolise both death and resurrection; the sap is also poisonous. Some time after I had given Harry his holly-and-phoenix wand I came across a description of how the <a href="/wiki/Celts" title="Celts">Celts</a> had assigned trees to different parts of the year and discovered that, entirely by coincidence, I had assigned Harry the ‘correct’ wood for his <a href="/wiki/31_July" title="31 July">day of birth</a>.</i>"<sup id="cite_ref-JKR_173-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-JKR-173">&#91;173&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
