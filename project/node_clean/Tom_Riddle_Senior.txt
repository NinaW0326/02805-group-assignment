<dd>&#8212;The circumstances of Tom Riddle, Snr's marriage<sup class="noprint"><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">[src]</a></sup></dd>
<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p><b>Tom Riddle, Senior</b> (<a href="/wiki/1905" title="1905">1905</a> – <a href="/wiki/1943" title="1943">1943</a>) was an <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">English</a> affluent <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> who lived in the village of <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton" title="Little Hangleton">Little Hangleton</a> located in <a href="/wiki/Yorkshire" title="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. He was the son of wealthy Muggles <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Riddle" title="Thomas Riddle">Thomas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Riddle" title="Mary Riddle">Mary Riddle</a>, who raised him to be snobbish and rude.
</p><p>Tom was coerced into marrying <a href="/wiki/Merope_Riddle" title="Merope Riddle">Merope Gaunt</a> by means of a <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a>. Merope stopped giving him the potion after sometime because she thought that he will start loving her naturally, at least for their unborn baby. But the desired did not happen. He left her once she stopped giving him the potion, sometime before the birth of their son, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a>, who would grow to become the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizard</a> Lord Voldemort. Tom Riddle, Snr was very handsome and this was what attracted Merope Gaunt.
</p><p>The latter’s sixteen-year-old son, Tom Marvolo Riddle, later <a href="/wiki/Murder_of_the_Riddle_family" title="Murder of the Riddle family">murdered</a> him and his grandparents in cold blood. This was in retaliation for what Tom, Jnr saw as his father's abandonment of his family. While neither his death nor that of his parents was notable among Muggles, as few Little Hangleton residents grieved, it would be pivotal in Wizarding history. His murder was used to make his <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt" title="Marvolo Gaunt">father-in-law's</a> <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_Ring" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s Ring">ring</a> into a <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, his last remaining <a href="/wiki/Bone" title="Bone">bone</a> helped his son return to full <a href="/wiki/Return_of_Lord_Voldemort" title="Return of Lord Voldemort">power</a>.

<dd>&#8212;Tom Marvolo Riddle, after revealing himself as Lord Voldemort to Harry Potter<sup class="noprint"><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">[src]</a></sup></dd>
<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>During Tom Marvolo Riddle's time at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, he originally believed that Tom Snr was a <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a>, and asked Albus Dumbledore about this during their first meeting, to which Dumbledore replied he could not recall any of his students by that name off the top of his head. However, after a long search of the Hogwarts alumni records, Tom failed to find his father's name on the rolls. He concluded that it was his mother, not father, that had magical abilities.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP17_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP17-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> He grew to harbour a passionate and ultimately deadly hatred for his father, believing that he had abandoned his mother after discovering her to be a witch, rather than fleeing her after she stopped giving him <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a>. (Ironically, up to this point he had been more accepting of his half-blood status when under the impression he had a wizard father, showing a long-time double standard, not unusual for the timespan in which he grew up and still not unusual today). His hatred led him to resent the entire race of Muggles.<sup id="cite_ref-CS17_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CS17-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> After an exhaustive search of the wizarding families, he found an unusual name: "Marvolo", which matched his middle name. In an attempt to seek out his maternal grandfather, Tom tracked down his father one summer, during his Hogwarts years, and murdered him and his <a href="/wiki/Riddle_family" title="Riddle family">family</a>. The blame was placed on <a href="/wiki/Morfin_Gaunt" title="Morfin Gaunt">Morfin Gaunt</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP17_10-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP17-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Tom Jnr used this death to make <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_ring" class="mw-redirect" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s ring">Marvolo Gaunt's ring</a> a <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP23_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP23-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> After that, he cast aside the name of his "filthy Muggle father" in order to fashion a new name to spare himself of the shame of having such a father.
</p><p>In a sense of irony, Tom Riddle's Muggle blood, despite being reviled, and his genes were extremely beneficial to his son. The teenage Tom Marvolo Riddle had a natural sense of calm and gentlemanly qualities (in public) which he had likely acquired from the inwardly aristocratic demeanour of Tom Riddle Senior. The father's good looks had also passed to his son, making Tom Marvolo Riddle a subject of admiration for many girls, witch and Muggle alike. This was in stark contrast to the rough-cut looks and boorish demeanour of the Gaunt men on Riddle's matrilineal side. Of course, Tom Marvolo Riddle eventually cast much of these aside, his once handsome visage warped from years of extensive Dark Arts experiments, his personality becoming much more dominating and short-tempered.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, Tom Senior proved useful to his son a second time. One of his bones was used to help <a href="/wiki/Return_of_the_Dark_Lord" class="mw-redirect" title="Return of the Dark Lord">revive his son's body</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF32_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF32-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Both Tom Senior and his son were obsessively loved by pure-blood witches. Tom Senior was loved by Merope, who became obsessed enough to use a Love Potion on him. Tom M. Riddle was obsessively loved by one of his <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>. Bellatrix was so eager to please him that she would "prune" her "family tree" by murdering <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">her niece</a>.
</p><p>Near the conclusion of the 20th century, Tom Riddle posthumously became a grandfather when his son sired a daughter, <a href="/wiki/Delphini" title="Delphini">Delphini</a>. It was unknown how Delphini viewed her paternal grandparents, although it seems that given her love for her father, she may have held posthumous love for Merope and Tom Riddle.
</p><p>In a further twist of irony and hypocrisy, Tom Marvolo Riddle became the exact type of absentee father he believed his father to be. Although he died when Delphini was very young, he did not exhibit any obvious signs that he was now responsible for an infant daughter, such as attempting to avoid Dumbledore's Army and the forthcoming fight that would result in his ultimate demise. Also, like Tom Riddle Senior, he outlived the woman with whom he sired the fruit of his loins.

<p>Tom was a snobbish and rude aristocrat during his life in <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton" title="Little Hangleton">Little Hangleton</a>. In the 1920s, Tom appeared to be caught up with the town gossip on the Gaunt Family. By the 1940s, Tom Riddle was noted to be more snobbish and rude than his already arrogant parents. The Riddle family thus was highly unpopular prior to the 1940s, and none of the town's residents even bothered to pretend to mourn for Tom's death. Instead, they were more concerned as to how he died, due to the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">lack of physical evidence</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF1_7-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF1-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> The mystery became the talk of the town partly out of fear it could happen again.
