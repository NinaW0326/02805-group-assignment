</p><p>He had hoped to be greeted by whispers and stares, as in his mind he was already a fully-fledged genius with an exceptional <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> prowess; the fact that he was merely ordinary, that more talented children were there, and that nobody was particularly impressed by his naturally wavy hair, disappointed him. He did have above-average abilities, and he was cleverer than most of his classmates, but he had a bad flaw in that he would not try unless he was confident that he was the best of whichever particular team, group, or class he happened to be with at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

</p><p>His vanity was such that he valued learning not for education, but because it granted him attention; he craved attention and prizes, and begged the <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">Headmaster</a> to start a school newspaper purely so he could see his own name in print. When these exploits failed to grant him attention, he took to grander, more dramatic means of garnering attention. Though he had never been popular with the other students, he did manage to achieve small notoriety by carving his signature in twenty foot long letters into the Quidditch pitch (earning him a weeks' worth of detentions), creating a <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart%27s_holographic_spell" title="Gilderoy Lockhart&#39;s holographic spell">spell</a> that shot a hologram of his own face into into the sky in imitation of the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a>, and sending himself eight-hundred Valentines, causing breakfast to be cancelled due to the number of droppings and feathers in the <a href="/wiki/Porridge" title="Porridge">porridge</a>.

<p>Albus Dumbledore, the Headmaster during Lockhart's time, happened to know two of the wizards whose memories Lockhart erased and easily deduced the truth behind Lockhart's fame and decided to make Lockhart pay for his crimes. He correctly believed that dragging Lockhart into a normal, school atmosphere would reveal his fraudulence, and with a vacancy in Defence Against the Dark Arts having opened up in June 1992, tracked down the author and offered Lockhart a job at Hogwarts (something Lockhart had not been too keen to do, as he saw how well his career as an author was progressing and because those who knew him from his time as a student like Minerva McGonagall and Severus Snape were still there as well).<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Dumbledore slyly hinted that <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> was a second-year student at the school, and being a teacher to the "famous Harry" would propel Lockhart's fame into the stratosphere. Ego, fame-hunger, and glory-thirst overruled caution, and Lockhart took the job. The other teachers remembered Lockhart as the obnoxious attention seeker back then, regardless of his later achievements, and were baffled at Dumbledore for inviting Lockhart to teach; <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>, in particular, asked what possibly could be learned from such a vainglorious man, in which the headmaster replied there was plenty to learn from even a bad teacher: what not to do, how not to be.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Hagrid correctly deduced that Lockhart only got the job because he was the only applicant for the <a href="/wiki/Jinx_on_the_post_of_Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts_teacher" title="Jinx on the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher">jinxed</a> position due to the fact that no one at the Ministry who was a specialist in Defence Against the Dark Arts with impeccable credentials or who was a trained professional who worked in either the <a href="/wiki/Auror_Office" title="Auror Office">Auror Office</a> or the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Force_Defence_League" title="Dark Force Defence League">Dark Force Defence League</a> wanted the job because of what happened to <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> at the end of the <a href="/wiki/1991-1992_school_year" class="mw-redirect" title="1991-1992 school year">1991-1992 school year</a>.

<p>For his first lesson, he showed everyone in his class what he really was. He first did this when he gave his second-year class a "<a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts_Second_Year_Essential_Knowledge_Test" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts Second Year Essential Knowledge Test">little quiz</a>" which was filled with questions that had nothing to do with Defence Against the Dark arts, but instead concerned his autobiography, <i><a href="/wiki/Magical_Me" title="Magical Me">Magical Me</a></i>, and the parts of his books just referring to him, such as what his favourite colour and his ideal birthday present was; he simply wanted to see how much the class has read his books. Despite his claim of "little", it ran for three pages with fifty-four questions, and only Hermione got all of them correct. He showed his true colours a second time when he then proceeded to release a cage full of "freshly caught" <a href="/wiki/Pixie" title="Pixie">Cornish Pixies</a> into the classroom, causing a large amount of pandemonium. He showed his true colours further a third time when he tried to stop them with a <a href="/wiki/Peskipiksi_Pesternomi" title="Peskipiksi Pesternomi">spell</a> that had absolutely no effect on the pixies and then irresponsibly instructed Harry, Ron, and Hermione to clean up after the mess while running back into his office.<sup id="cite_ref-COS6_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS6-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>He was not the least bit popular among his fellow Hogwarts staff members and constantly gave them unsolicited pieces of advice on their specialities. Harry and his friends (except for Hermione Granger) also found him quite obnoxious and could not take him seriously as a Professor. Even <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>, the Gamekeeper, who usually refrained from criticising teachers, showed public disdain for Lockhart.<sup id="cite_ref-COS7_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS7-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Many male students, such as <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, saw immediately that Lockhart was an annoying and incompetent fool whose reason for doing so poorly was because he had no idea what he was doing, and gave him very little respect outside of his presence. However, Lockhart's charms had attracted many schoolgirls such as <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Susan_Bones" title="Susan Bones">Susan Bones</a>. <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> students who have recently been introduced into the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a>, such as <a href="/wiki/Justin_Finch-Fletchley" title="Justin Finch-Fletchley">Justin Finch-Fletchley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Colin_Creevey" title="Colin Creevey">Colin Creevey</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-COS6_11-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS6-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> also admired Lockhart due to their lack of experience with the magical community, and easily ate up his tall tales.

<p>After the pixie chaos, Lockhart did not bring any more live creatures into class, but instead read from his books and re-enacted several portions of his "achievements," sometimes dragging Harry to help him with it. The only reason Harry agreed to do so was to get signed permission from Lockhart for a <a href="/wiki/Moste_Potente_Potions" title="Moste Potente Potions">book</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Restricted_Section" title="Restricted Section">Restricted Section</a> of the library, which Lockhart signed without even paying attention to what book they wanted (Hermione claimed she was interested in reading more about <a href="/wiki/Slow-acting_venom" title="Slow-acting venom">Slow-acting venoms</a>, but in reality she wanted to learn how to brew <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-COS10_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS10-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> His idea of <a href="/wiki/Homework" title="Homework">homework</a> included composing a poem of one of his alleged achievements and offered a signed copy of his autobiography as a reward to the best composer. Due to Lockhart's overall poor performances, the class did not learn anything about true Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Ron claimed that he only learned not to set pixies loose, and would have dropped the course had he been allowed to.<sup id="cite_ref-COS14_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS14-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Lockhart's once powerful potential had been wasted from years of misuse and neglect, resulting in him being unable to properly teach (or even understand what he was attempting at times).

This is evident by how not even the <a href="/wiki/Healer" title="Healer">Healers</a> at St Mungo's had been informed about the details around his admittance, as <a href="/wiki/Miriam_Strout" title="Miriam Strout">Miriam Strout</a>, one of the employees at the long-time ward he was admitted to, spoke casually about how Gilderoy had been "quite well-known a few years ago" and were optimistic to the prospect of Gilderoy's signs of improvement later in his treatment.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP23_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP23-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Due to this, the ex-professor was allowed to continue his career as an author, after a fashion, getting someone to help him write the book <i>Who Am I?</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-COSF_14-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COSF-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> Based on Miriam's statement, it appears that the wizarding world in general came to forget about Lockhart.

Ron felt somewhat guilty since his malfunctioning wand was responsible for damaging Lockhart's memories, but Harry felt less sympathetic, for it was Lockhart's attempt to remove their memories in the first place that resulted in this backfire.

<p>Gilderoy Lockhart's defining characteristics were his extreme arrogance and exceeding vanity, conceit, egomania, narcissism and self-obsession. He was a voracious self-promoter and claimed to have done many great deeds, though in actuality he was a fraud and merely took credit for other wizards and witches' accomplishments and whose claims about himself were for the most part nothing but conceit, self-praise, and vanity and whose claims about other things were idle speculations, gross exaggerations, and pure sensationalism; he went as far as to claim his winning of the <a href="/wiki/Witch_Weekly%27s_Most_Charming_Smile_Award" title="Witch Weekly&#39;s Most Charming Smile Award">Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award</a> five times in a row was more impressive than Harry Potter defeating <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-COS6_11-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS6-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>He also made outrageous claims and suggestions, whether about other people's professions or in times of danger, in order to make himself look more important and powerful than he truly was. Like Stan Shunpike, Gilderoy tends to come up with fabricated concepts on the spot rather frequently just to impress his admirers. Even as a student, he already made far-fetched claims of his goals such as creating a <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a> before graduation, intending to captain England's Quidditch team to World Cup glory, before knuckling down to becoming Britain’s youngest Minister for Magic, none of which he accomplished. His attempts to earn himself more fame also led him to attempt spells without fully understanding them (such as removing Harry's bones instead of mending them, and <a href="/wiki/Alarte_Ascendare" title="Alarte Ascendare">launching a snake into the air</a> instead of making it vanish).<sup id="cite_ref-COS11_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS11-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> It is also speculated that he invented some <a href="/wiki/Incantation" title="Incantation">incantations</a> and names for <a href="/wiki/Spell" title="Spell">spells</a> that do not actually exist, such as <i><a href="/wiki/Peskipiksi_Pesternomi" title="Peskipiksi Pesternomi">Peskipiksi Pesternomi</a></i> (a proven nonsense incantation),<sup id="cite_ref-COS6_11-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS6-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> and possibly the <a href="/wiki/Transmogrifian_Torture" title="Transmogrifian Torture">Transmogrifian Torture</a> along with the <a href="/wiki/Homorphus_Charm" title="Homorphus Charm">Homorphus Charm</a>. Indeed, many of his books contained a large number of invented details to promote his supposed feats.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Lockhart was very proud of his books, since his falsely-acquired achievements recorded within were highly popular with its readers, and would always make reference to them whenever giving advice based on his so-called experience.
</p><p>In addition to his self-promoting nature, he was also highly impractical, to the point of being reckless, in many situations. When the Chamber of Secrets opened, he made many pointless suggestions and false volunteers despite the seriousness of the situation, and his "morale booster" outright disturbed classes instead of building up confidence. His school lectures and materials were simply selling his overly expensive autobiographies while reading out chapters from these uninformative books and even theatrically reenacting them, thus lacking any educational purposes. He insisted on mass-producing his own <a href="/wiki/Occamy_egg_yolk_shampoo" title="Occamy egg yolk shampoo">shampoo</a> despite the ingredients being too dangerous and expensive to procure, especially for something as superficial as hair-care. With a little flattering, Hermione Granger was able to get Lockhart to sign a permission form for a book within the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Library" title="Hogwarts Library">library's</a> <a href="/wiki/Restricted_Section" title="Restricted Section">Restricted Section</a>, to which Lockhart did not even bother to look at the <a href="/wiki/Moste_Potente_Potions" title="Moste Potente Potions">book</a> she wanted, much less question her for reasons for wanting a potentially dangerous document, which other teachers would not be so reckless.<sup id="cite_ref-COS10_21-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS10-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Later, being the only teacher to not take the reopening of the Chamber of Secrets seriously, he neglected his duties of leading his students to their next class when Harry and Ron flattered him, as Ron pointed out, in order to fix his hair. Even in his time as a student, his antics of garnering attention caused huge amounts of trouble that earned him scorn and loathing instead of the popularity and praise he desired.
</p><p>Lockhart's overbearing self-centred personality and insensitivity irked most of the people he encountered who were not included among his fans. His unprofessional behaviour earned him the dislike of the Hogwarts faculty, as well as many of the students. However, his arrogance did have limits and he recognised that Albus Dumbledore, his employer and Headmaster of Hogwarts, was a greater wizard than he was, as he never displayed that he believed himself to be above Dumbledore. Also, like many magical folk (human and nonhuman alike) Lockhart feared Voldemort to the point where he could not call him by his name. Lockhart was overall considered a joke by Hogwarts, and when he left due to memory loss, the majority (if not the entirety) of the school was elated to see him go.

<p>He also seemed to be completely oblivious to the reactions he elicited from other people or misinterpreted them completely. When Ron looked revolted at his ostentatious peacock quill, Lockhart thought Ron was admiring it. He ignored Harry's many attempts to contradict his theories of enjoying his company and attention, as well as Harry's pleas for Lockhart to leave his broken arm alone, and also completely failed to notice the looks of hatred he received from the rest of the faculty for his ignorance. He asserted that Hogwarts was safe from the <a href="/wiki/Serpent_of_Slytherin" title="Serpent of Slytherin">monster of Slytherin</a> after Hagrid was arrested, claiming extra security was no longer necessary, and though proven wrong almost immediately, Lockhart stubbornly refused to retract his earlier claims, and continued to complain about how the extra security was tiring him out. His ignorance, arrogance, and self-serving nature ultimately led to his downfall when he attempted to use Ron's <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley%27s_first_wand" class="mw-redirect" title="Ronald Weasley&#39;s first wand">damaged wand</a> to perform the complex Memory Charm despite seeing the backfires it has caused over the year (mainly in the Duelling Club), evidently forgetting the dangers of attempting such a feat (or that the wand was even damaged).<sup id="cite_ref-COS16_12-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS16-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When faced with true danger, Gilderoy showed his true nature of a self-serving coward. He attempted to flee from Hogwarts when the other teachers pressured him into entering the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> after Ginny Weasley's abduction (though this was more to get him out of the way so the teachers could get the real work done), and claim that his books can be misleading, contradicting his past vain support on them. Even after the location of the Chamber's entrance was discovered, he was willing to leave Ginny Weasley to die, attempting to modify Harry and Ron's memories to cover himself.<sup id="cite_ref-COS16_12-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS16-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Although Lockhart started out as a clever and very skilled student, being sorted into <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a> house, his main flaw was that he would never try in his studies (or anything) unless he was the very best at it, having been spoiled by his mother's overly affection and his own ego. Even in his childhood, he already expected the students and teachers to greet him with admiration and excitement, as he deluded himself into thinking he is a genius above all others of undeserved rights, and was very disappointed and dulled when he was not given any special treatments. He studied not for education, but for attention and awards, and spent much of his time with annoying vanity projects for fame and glory that instead earned him a small notoriety.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> He was never an unskilled wizard, just a lazy one who increasingly directed his talents to insincere shortcuts and cowardly dodges; his gifts wasted away, as the only spell he focused on was the <a href="/wiki/Memory_Charm" title="Memory Charm">Memory Charm</a>. His abilities eventually deteriorated nearly beyond the point of recovery, which went past that point when he was struck with his own backfiring Memory Charm. Despite his ineptitude in most other areas of magic due to long-term neglect and misuse, Lockhart was skilled in Memory Charms, it being the one spell he focused on for his entire life, and was conniving enough to deceive other wizards and witches to thoroughly reveal their work to him before erasing their memories and claim the credits for himself. He also appeared to have been a skilled writer, publishing many books consisting primarily of his embellishments of other people's achievements, taking credit for them as his own. Given his propensity for lying, however, it cannot be said for certain that Lockhart himself actually wrote any of the books, though he did understand that the readers would not be nearly half as interested in his books if they realised his feats were no more than fictionalised plagiarism. He also added many invented details in such feats to promote himself further, distorting facts with fictional concepts.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Lockhart's fraudulent lifestyle has proven a certain degree of cunning, resourcefulness and disregard for rules, qualities that fall under the specifics of <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>, which he was narrowly able to avoid being sorted into.
</p><p>In addition to his other flaws, Lockhart may have had a spiteful streak in him. After learning from Hagrid that the Gamekeeper hadn't read any of his books and that Harry Potter was more famous than Lockhart without trying, Lockhart was put out and later insisted that Harry serve detention with him so he could show off his fan mail to Harry and gloat about it. After Hagrid's arrest, Lockhart openly claimed to be certain that Hagrid was truly guilty,<sup id="cite_ref-COS16_12-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS16-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> but whether this was a real hint of ill will or another sign of Lockhart's ignorance is unknown.
</p><p>By his own claims (written in his many published works), his favourite colour was lilac, his secret ambitions were to rid the world of evil and to market his own range of hair care potions, and that he desired harmony between magic and non-magic peoples as a birthday present.<sup id="cite_ref-COS6_11-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS6-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Given his egotistical and self-serving cowardice attributes, some of these may have been fabrications to boost Lockhart's own reputation as opposed to truth. His empty ambitiousness shown since his studentship, such as claiming to create a <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a> before graduation, captain the England Quidditch team into championship before knuckling down to become the youngest Minister for Magic yet accomplishing none of which he speak, it is very likely his "secret ambition" and "ideal birthday present" were just the same meaningless claims to gain attention.
</p><p>After losing his memory, however, Lockhart became a much more humble and happier person, even if he did not particularly know it. Upon seeing Harry and Ginny after the spell hit him, he greeted them cheerfully and spent most of the time humming to himself absentmindedly. When addressed as Professor, he expressed surprise at the idea and remarked that he must have been hopeless, without any reluctance at all. Despite forgetting his desire for fame and attention, he continued to enjoy signing autographs and responding to fan letters, a trait that Harry noted had not changed.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP23_13-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP23-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In his youth, Gilderoy was acknowledged by his professors as having been cleverer than most of his classmates, having been of above-average in intelligence and ability,<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> and for having had the potential to become a great <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a> by his teachers, had he just decided to work hard to get there. Years of misuse and abandonment and sole focus on the Memory Charm eventually diminished and rusted his <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> abilities nearly beyond repair, thus making him unskilled and incompetent in most fields of magic.
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Charm" title="Charm">Charms</a></b>: Lockhart demonstrated most of his genuine magical abilities in the field of charms. By the time Lockhart returned to Hogwarts, his magical skills had become irreparably neglected, with his only real focus being the <a href="/wiki/Memory_Charm" title="Memory Charm">Memory Charm</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> an advanced charm which he spent years perfecting. He eventually reached the level where he could cast the intricate charm without fail on any situation, considering himself highly gifted with it. Indeed, not only did he manage to do so to accomplished wizards and witches upon catching them off-guard, enabling him to propel himself to fame by stealing their credit without suspicion, but he on at least one occasion wiped the memories of a whole room with a single spell.<sup id="cite_ref-HM5_18-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM5-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> Lockhart was also able to produce a non-corporeal <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-LEGOY1_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LEGOY1-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LEGOY2_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LEGOY2-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Lockhart was also able to cast a number of simple enchantments successfully, such as the <a href="/wiki/Tickling_Charm" title="Tickling Charm">Tickling Charm</a>, <a href="/wiki/Softening_Charm" title="Softening Charm">Softening Charm</a>, <a href="/wiki/Verdimillious_Charm" title="Verdimillious Charm">Verdimillious Charm</a>, <a href="/wiki/Verdimillious_Duo_Spell" title="Verdimillious Duo Spell">Verdimillious Duo Spell</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/Verdimillious_Tria" title="Verdimillious Tria">Verdimillious Tria</a></i> <a href="/wiki/Knockback_Jinx" title="Knockback Jinx">Knockback Jinx</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tongue-Tying_Curse" title="Tongue-Tying Curse">Tongue-Tying Curse</a>, <a href="/wiki/Full_Body-Bind_Curse" title="Full Body-Bind Curse">Full Body-Bind Curse</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-COSG_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COSG-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Freezing_Charm" title="Freezing Charm">Freezing Charm</a><sup id="cite_ref-LEGOY1_7-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LEGOY1-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Levitation" title="Levitation">levitation</a> spell <i><a href="/wiki/Alarte_Ascendare" title="Alarte Ascendare">Alarte Ascendare</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-COS11_23-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS11-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> Lockhart furthermore claimed to have the ability to cast the immensely difficult <a href="/wiki/Homorphus_Charm" title="Homorphus Charm">Homorphus Charm</a>, a charm that could change Werewolves to <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">human</a> form.<sup id="cite_ref-COS10_21-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS10-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Having taken credit for the defeat of the <a href="/wiki/Wagga_Wagga_Werewolf" title="Wagga Wagga Werewolf">Wagga Wagga Werewolf</a> from a more accomplished and courageous person, however, it was unlikely this was the case.

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a></b>: Lockhart claimed himself to be an expert in the field of fighting the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a>, although given his fraudulence and lack of genuine experience, he was an incompetent <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a> of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. His lessons were nonsensical and lacking in useful intellectual content, nonetheless, he had at least some theoretical knowledge of this subject.

Furthermore, Lockhart claimed to have considerable understanding in this field, such as by his claim of to have knowledge of a lethal <a href="/wiki/Curse" title="Curse">curse</a> known as the <a href="/wiki/Transmogrifian_Torture" title="Transmogrifian Torture">Transmogrifian Torture</a>, and the relevant <a href="/wiki/Counter-curse_for_the_Transmogrifian_Torture" title="Counter-curse for the Transmogrifian Torture">counter-curse</a> to it,<sup id="cite_ref-COS9_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS9-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> but given his deceit, his claims were not fully verified.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Magizoology" title="Magizoology">Magizoology</a></b>: Although Lockhart was not even able to control a simple cage of Cornish <a href="/wiki/Pixie" title="Pixie">Pixies</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-COS6_11-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS6-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> he still displayed a reasonable amount of knowledge on <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> <a href="/wiki/Creature" title="Creature">creatures</a>. He appeared to have at least learned the theory of how to understand and handle them based on the books he wrote, which were based on actual feats other wizards and witches achieved. He was able to teach his students about various dark creatures he had supposedly encountered in his DADA lessons, such as <a href="/wiki/Banshee" title="Banshee">Banshees</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ghoul" title="Ghoul">Ghouls</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hag" title="Hag">Hags</a>, <a href="/wiki/Troll" title="Troll">Trolls</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vampire" title="Vampire">Vampires</a>, <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">Werewolves</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yeti" title="Yeti">Yetis</a> to some degree,<sup id="cite_ref-COS10_21-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS10-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> but fell short of teaching them practical manners of defending themselves from them, meaning his experience in this field was limited.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Spell_creation" title="Spell creation">Spell creation</a></b>: While still a student at Hogwarts, Gilderoy invented a <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart%27s_holographic_spell" title="Gilderoy Lockhart&#39;s holographic spell">spell</a> that sent skyward a glowing, holographic image of his own face, similar to the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  Given how spell creation is a particularly advanced, complicated and even dangerous branch of <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a>, his ability to invent his own <a href="/wiki/Spell" title="Spell">spell</a> was proof of his potential superior magical potential and ability in his youth.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Nonverbal_spell" title="Nonverbal spell">Nonverbal magic</a></b>: Gilderoy Lockhart was capable of casting spells without having to say the <a href="/wiki/Incantation" title="Incantation">incantation</a> aloud, which is highly advanced, <a href="/wiki/Nastily_Exhausting_Wizarding_Test" title="Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test">N.E.W.T.</a>-level magic. Rusty from neglecting his magical prowess, however, he did so with varying success. For example, although he performed the charm <i><a href="/wiki/Alarte_Ascendare" title="Alarte Ascendare">Alarte Ascendare</a></i> without fail,<sup id="cite_ref-COS11_23-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS11-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> he later accidentally <a href="/wiki/Vanishment" title="Vanishment">vanished</a> the bones in Harry's arm after casting a spell to <a href="/wiki/Brackium_Emendo" title="Brackium Emendo">mend broken bones</a> inaccurately.<sup id="cite_ref-COS10_21-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS10-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> He could also cast a non-verbal <a href="/wiki/Knockback_Jinx" title="Knockback Jinx">Knockback Jinx</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-COSG_17-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COSG-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Potion" title="Potion">Potions</a></b>: Lockhart possessed a reasonable level of talent in potion making as an amateur <a href="/wiki/Potioneer" title="Potioneer">Potioneer</a>. He invented a <a href="/wiki/Occamy_egg_yolk_shampoo" title="Occamy egg yolk shampoo">shampoo</a> made of <a href="/wiki/Occamy_egg" title="Occamy egg">Occamy egg</a> yolks, which provided <a href="/wiki/Human_hair" title="Human hair">hair</a> with "locks of lustrous luminosity", showing success with the potion's creation. However, the product proved to be a failure, proving to be too expensive to put on the market, along with the procurement of the main ingredient being too dangerous.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Furthermore Lockhart claimed to have the ability to "whip up a <a href="/wiki/Mandrake_Restorative_Draught" title="Mandrake Restorative Draught">Mandrake Restorative Draught</a> in my sleep",<sup id="cite_ref-COS9_29-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS9-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> but this claim like his others, was most likely false.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Healing_magic" title="Healing magic">Healing magic</a></b>: Lockhart had a fair amount of knowledge, if limited ability in medical magic. This was apparent when he after a moment's examination of Harry's arm was able to both correctly conclude that his arm was broken, as well as to perform the <a href="/wiki/Brackium_Emendo" title="Brackium Emendo">approrpiate spell</a> to mend the injury, although his lack of experience led him to cast it incorrectly, thus accidentally <a href="/wiki/Vanishment" title="Vanishment">vanishing</a> the bones.<sup id="cite_ref-COS10_21-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS10-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">Flying</a></b>: According to Lockhart sometime during his Hogwarts years, he played for the <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw_Quidditch_team" title="Ravenclaw Quidditch team">Ravenclaw Quidditch team</a> as <a href="/wiki/Seeker" title="Seeker">Seeker</a>, meaning he must have been a skilled <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a> flyer and <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> player in his youth.<sup id="cite_ref-quidditch_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-quidditch-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> However, it is unknown if he retained his flying skills in adulthood, given his neglect of his other magical abilities.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Apparition</a></b>: Like most accomplished adult wizards and witches, Lockhart was capable of apparating successfully at will.<sup id="cite_ref-HM5_18-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM5-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Intelligence</b>: Lockhart teachers acknowledged him as being cleverer than most of his fellow students and he got good marks on his schoolwork. The full extent of Lockhart's cunning and resourcefulness was demonstrated in his adulthood when he managed to successfully take credit for the achievements of other wizards. His unscrupulous cleverness was prominent enough that he was nearly sorted into Slytherin, which was demonstrated in his pursuit for fame. He was capable of easily deceiving nearly the entire magical community (apart from Dumbledore) that he was a highly accomplished wizard and courageous hero, while in actuality he was a fraud who stole the credit for the achievements of more courageous and accomplished wizards for his books. It was only because Dumbledore decided to expose him by luring him into becoming a teacher at Hogwarts, knowing he would make a horrible teacher, that he was finally exposed.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Tracking skills</b>: Lockhart was able to track down other witches and wizards whose achievements he fraudulently took for his own,<sup id="cite_ref-COS16_12-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS16-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> showing he was skilled at tracking down certain individuals.</li>
<li><b>Knowledge</b>: In addition to his seven years worth of education at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, where he learned, not for the sake of learning but for the attention it brought him, Lockhart also displayed an intellectual dedication through his endeavour to take credit from other accomplished wizards.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Having amassed a great deal of knowledge in magical feats and creatures, he was knowledgeable of the existence various complex spells such as the <a href="/wiki/Homorphus_Charm" title="Homorphus Charm">Homorphus Charm</a> and <a href="/wiki/Transmogrifian_Torture" title="Transmogrifian Torture">Transmogrifian Torture</a>, among many other things, even if he couldn't put them into practice himself and only knew the basic theory. Willing to educate himself if it could bring him attention, honours and glory, he gave irking suggestions on how his fellow professors to improve in areas on which they themselves were experts, and being able to maintain the facade of being accomplished in a multitude of fields suggested he had at the very least a minimum of knowledge in those disciplines.</li>
<li><b>Actor</b>: Lockhart was also highly adept in acting and deceiving others, as he was able to fool the wizards and witches whose heroic deeds he used as a basis for his books to tell him thoroughly how they achieved their feats so he can pretend that he did it perfectly before modifying their memory and making them forget. His acting skills also contributed in his ability to completely hide his fraudulence and ineptitude in most fields of magic from almost all of the Wizarding World with his tall tales, making him world-wide famous, with only Dumbledore seeing through Lockhart's facade.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> His charisma also helped to boost his popularity in the eye of the wizarding public. It was only when he took on the position as a teacher did his act finally fell apart, as he lacked the required experience to know actually how to deal with the Dark Arts.</li>
<li><b>Author</b>: Lockhart's most significant skill apart from his speciality with Memory Charms was that he was an extremely accomplished author, which was the career he chose after leaving Hogwarts. His skills as an author were such that he was able to completely hide both his fraudulence and magical ineptitude to the general public by claiming credit in his books for deeds which other witches and wizards had done. He did this to the point that he was initially idolised by the majority of the wizarding world and many Hogwarts students.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Even after his memories were erased, Lockhart still retained some of his writing skills despite his popularity having fallen, which was shown when he wrote and published the book <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Am_I%3F" title="Who Am I?">Who Am I?</a>.</i><sup id="cite_ref-COSF_14-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COSF-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Artist</b>: At a glance, Lockhart appeared to be a talented and accomplished painter, often painting exquisite portraits of himself in his free time. His talent in painting <a href="/wiki/Portrait" title="Portrait">portraits</a> of simply himself further showcased his extravagant vanity and his love of aesthetics.<sup id="cite_ref-COSF_14-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COSF-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>

<p>Lockhart was an accomplished author, with twelve of his books shown. Although nine of them were supposed to be about eradicating <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">dark forces</a>, they were in fact just recollections of his experiences (of which he stole from other people) and his personal profiles, somewhat an extension of his autobiography, and contained a good deal of invented details as opposed to pure facts.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-COS16_12-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS16-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> All of these (with the exception of <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Am_I%3F" title="Who Am I?">Who Am I?</a></i>) were published at some point between <a href="/wiki/1982" title="1982">1982</a> and <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, before his stint as a Hogwarts professor. Due to the immense popularity, the books were very expensive; he gifted an entire set to Harry Potter as a publicity stunt at <a href="/wiki/Flourish_and_Blotts" title="Flourish and Blotts">Flourish and Blotts</a>, which Harry donated to Ginny Weasley.<sup id="cite_ref-COS4_9-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS4-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>

His mother loved him more than she did her two daughters, which, when combined with Gilderoy's revealed wizardry and acceptance into Hogwarts, lead his vanity to grow like a weed. Both mother and son were too excited to remember that Hogwarts accepts <i>all</i> magical students from Britain and Ireland, and she was as deluded as her son in thinking that he was special amongst all children of his age. Due to Mrs Lockhart's overly <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a> and pampering, she completely spoiled and deluded her son, which would lead to a very negative impact on his future.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When Gilderoy was admitted to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries due to self-inflicted amnesia, none of his family members nor relatives visited him. This implies that they too despised him and had no desire to spend time with him, or that they were even unaware of his unfortunate predicament, or had simply cut all contacts with him before. Even his mother who overly doted him did not visit, suggesting she was either deceased or came to hate him for his vain and annoying antics.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP23_13-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP23-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>

<p>During his time as a Ravenclaw student, Lockhart was already unpopular with the school's residents, students like The <a href="/wiki/Marauders" title="Marauders">Marauders</a> and Severus Snape and the staff alike, almost immediately due to his being a spoiled child with a brat's sense of entitlement, self-delusions, and obnoxious personality. He was expecting everyone to whisper and stare about him and found it dull and disappointing when they did not, especially when they were not particularly impressed by his naturally wavy hair, of which he was very proud. His attempts to gain himself more attention did him little good; instead they made him more of an annoying troublemaker when he begged <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">Headmaster</a> Albus Dumbledore to start a school newspaper solely for his own name to appear in its print, carved his name into the Quidditch pitch (earning him a weeks' worth of detentions), shooting a hologram of his own face into the sky like the Dark Mark, and sending himself eight-hundred Valentines, causing breakfast to be cancelled due to the number of droppings and feathers in the porridge. His squandering of his own talents and refusal to take his studies seriously also earned him the scorn of his teachers, when they once hoped that if he had worked hard, he might have made something positive of his gifts. Lockhart's graduation was met with a faint sigh of relief from the entire staff. It was easily apparent that all of them would not hesitate to and perhaps even looked for opportunities to punish Lockhart out of sheer annoyance of his troublemaking and attention seeking personality, with the only Professor who didn't resent Lockhart and was willing to tolerate his antics appears to be Dumbledore, as he apparently saw Lockhart's antics as amusing rather than irritating, evidenced by the fact that Lockhart's pleads for Dumbledore to start a school newspaper was the only time where Lockhart managed to get away unpunished. When word of his supposed accomplishments of Defence Against the Dark Arts have reached his former educators' and, in Snape's case, peers ears, they began to think they had misjudged him due to his seeming resilience and bravery, unaware he was a mere charlatan who stole the credit of accomplishments made by true heroes. This misunderstanding, however, did not change their opinion on his annoying, attention-seeking personality, and they would later see him as the incompetent fraud he was.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>When Lockhart had erased the memories of two wizards Dumbledore knew personally, Dumbledore, having never been fooled by Lockhart's tall tales and always being suspicious of how Lockhart came to fame due to knowing just what kind of a person Lockhart was, easily deduced the truth behind Lockhart's fame and saw through his charade and decided to track him down and make him pay for his crimes. Dumbledore offered Lockhart a position as the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher, under the correct belief that school is the best location to expose the fraud for what he was. Lockhart was reluctant at first, as he was more interested in his successful career as an author, but was instantly swayed when Dumbledore mentioned Harry Potter's fame, which Lockhart would believe as a boost to his own.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> The other professors, who remembered Lockhart as obnoxious, were baffled at Dumbledore's choice to invite Lockhart back to Hogwarts, and Minerva even asked what possible benefits could students gain from such a vain man;<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> according to Hagrid, the main reason for Lockhart's appointment was that he was the only applicant for the <a href="/wiki/Jinx_on_the_post_of_Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts_teacher" title="Jinx on the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher">jinxed</a> position after what happened to Quirrell something the other teachers agree on, but still thought Lockhart's personality outweighed the desperate need for a new teacher. Dumbledore appeared to be the only one who Lockhart didn't express superiority to and possibly held some level of respect for his old headmaster.

<p>Even Rubeus Hagrid, who normally would never have criticised a teacher, publicly expressed disdain for Lockhart and did not believe any of Lockhart's fabricated claims, saying he would eat his <a href="/wiki/Kettle" title="Kettle">kettle</a> if they were true.<sup id="cite_ref-COS7_20-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS7-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Lockhart, on the other hand, did not seem to notice the resentment the teachers had for him, and instead kept on annoying everyone.

<p>Gilderoy was particularly disliked by Professor Snape for not only taking the teaching post he coveted so much but also for his constant and presumptuous attempts to advise Snape with largely nonsensical suggestions: In fact, Lockhart was probably on top of the list of the DADA professor Snape resented the most, with the only possible exception being <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, who even then still got along better with Snape than Lockhart despite Snape's resentment. Snape looked as though he was prepared to kill Lockhart during the Duelling Club, as Harry described, and something even Lockhart eventually saw when he looked at Snape's expression.<sup id="cite_ref-COS11_23-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS11-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> He was the most miserable of the teachers of Hogwarts when Lockhart held a Valentine Day celebration, to the point Harry described Snape at this point as "looking as if he had been forced to drink multiple <a href="/wiki/Skele-Gro" title="Skele-Gro">Skele-Gro</a>" and when Lockhart encouraged the students to ask Snape to teach them how to brew <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a>, Snape looked as if he would force-fed <a href="/wiki/Poison" title="Poison">poison</a> to anyone who dared to ask him.<sup id="cite_ref-COS13_24-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS13-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> When <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a> was taken into the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, Snape immediately sent Lockhart to deal with the <a href="/wiki/Serpent_of_Slytherin" title="Serpent of Slytherin">monster within</a>. The other teachers agreed unanimously, in the hopes of scaring Lockhart away, especially considering he had walked in obliviously while the other teachers were devastated by Ginny's impending doom; it was during this situation that they were all glaring at him with genuine hatred, something that he remained oblivious to. In revenge, they took Lockhart's earlier claims and used it against him, while ignoring his attempt to stammer his way out with feeble excuses.<sup id="cite_ref-COS16_12-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS16-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>While unpopular during his time as a student,<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Lockhart, as a teacher, had a mixed relationship with the students of Hogwarts: about half of them admired him for his celebrity status, while the other half resented him for being obnoxious and fake. However, by the end of the year, when Lockhart revealed his own fraudulence and left school due to his accidental self-induced amnesia, pretty much every student gave their round of applause at the news.<sup id="cite_ref-COS18_26-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS18-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The half of the students who initially admired him were mostly girls like <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Susan_Bones" title="Susan Bones">Susan Bones</a>, who fell for his good looks, and people who actually believed in the accomplishments in his books, such as <a href="/wiki/Justin_Finch-Fletchley" title="Justin Finch-Fletchley">Justin Finch-Fletchley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Colin_Creevey" title="Colin Creevey">Colin Creevey</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-COS6_11-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS6-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> They remained ignorant of Lockhart's true colours, even when he revealed them little by little throughout his terrible performances. When he was finally exposed as a fraud, they most likely abandoned their faith in him.
</p><p>Much like most of the faculty, the other half of the students simply found Lockhart to be annoying. Many of them showed little knowledge or interest in his history or published works, as they all did rather poorly on his <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts_Second_Year_Essential_Knowledge_Test" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts Second Year Essential Knowledge Test">"little" quiz</a> that purely consisted of questions about him.<sup id="cite_ref-COS6_11-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS6-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Him not teaching them anything useful had caused a rift for their education experience. Even those who showed no outright sympathy either for or against Lockhart, such as the <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherins</a>, appeared to have no respect for and could easily enjoy and mock him behind his back, as <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> mocked Harry for being dragged into the spotlight by the professor,<sup id="cite_ref-COS4_9-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS4-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> and along with the other Slytherins cheered when Snape effortlessly grounded Lockhart at the <a href="/wiki/Duelling_Club" title="Duelling Club">Duelling Club</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Disarming Charm</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-COS11_23-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS11-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>It appears that the only one in the Staff and virtually all of Hogwarts who had any amount of pity and compassion for Lockhart and his current state was Dumbledore himself. While he had purposefully intended for Lockhart to be exposed as a fraud to the Wizarding World and evidently disapproved of Lockhart's attention-seeking , Dumbledore notably chose not to expose Lockhart's crimes to the public. Despite Lockhart's fraudulent nature, Dumbledore likely thought that the loss of his memory was punishment enough. Since Lockhart would not remember either the so called accomplishments or his fraudulent behaviour, it would be cruel to expose him to a likely sentence in Azkaban. It is also notable that unlike all the other professors, Dumbledore was always civil and cordial to Lockhart despite knowing of his crimes, further implying while Dumbledore decided to expose Lockhart, he bore no personal animosity to him and only did so to protect more heroes from being denied their rights to be acknowledged for their deeds. Lockhart himself clearly admired and respected Dumbledore, as he never claimed to surpass Dumbledore and was always polite to him and never directly or indirectly annoyed him, which is a sharp contrast compared to his interactions with the other teachers, indicating that despite his vanity, Lockhart's acknowledgement of how great Dumbledore also came with the acknowledgement that Dumbledore obviously surpassed him, a fact that was very much true. It appears that before he lost his memories that Dumbledore was the only staff member that Lockhart ever had any respect for.<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorebio_1-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorebio-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p><b>Gilderoy</b> was a name that <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> found in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewer%27s_Dictionary_of_Phrase_and_Fable" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Brewer&#39;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable">Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable</a></i>. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.bartleby.com/81/7172.html">According to the dictionary</a>, the name belongs to two different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highwayman" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Highwayman">highway men</a> who were both described as incredibly handsome.<sup id="cite_ref-name_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-name-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p><i>Gilderoy</i> is an Irish and Scottish name that refers back to <i>Gilroy</i>, which means "son of the red-haired servant", or "son of the king's servant."
</p><p>Interestingly, <i>"Gilderoy"</i> is similar to the term "gilded", which means both to cover something in a thin layer of gold to appear valuable and golden (when in reality it isn't), and "wealthy and privileged", both of which apply well to Gilderoy's character.

<ul><li>Observing his flamboyant clothes, it is not difficult to imagine Lockhart as an expert of fashion and a regular reader of fashion magazines (and indeed, many fans found him to be a stylish character in the film series). Furthermore, he received <a href="/wiki/Britain%27s_Best_Dressed_Wizard_Award" title="Britain&#39;s Best Dressed Wizard Award">Britain's Best Dressed Wizard Award</a> sometime before <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>. Considering that his secret ambition is to market his own range of <a href="/wiki/Hair_care_potions" title="Hair care potions">hair care potions</a>, he may also be an expert on hair care and, possibly, makeup.</li>
<li>As one of Lockhart's stated ambitions was "harmony between magic and non-magic peoples," he may be in favour of greater rights for Muggles, though is not known to have done anything to specifically champion the cause. Given his ego, he probably regretted that his fame was limited to the wizarding community. This said, and despite his other failings, he never once demonstrates any pure-blood prejudice. He in fact dotes on students such as Harry Potter, who is also a half-blood, and Hermione Granger, who is Muggle-born. Lockhart himself is half-blood.</li>
<li>Since Lockhart went to Hogwarts from <a href="/wiki/1975" title="1975">1975</a>-<a href="/wiki/1982" title="1982">1982</a>, he would have attended Hogwarts around the same time as Lily Evans, Severus Snape, and the Marauders, who would have been fifth years when he began attending. This could explain Snape's disdain towards him. Snape also started teaching Potions when Gilderoy was in his seventh year, and may have taught him if Gilderoy took N.E.W.T. level potions.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> has stated that Lockhart's name was taken from a church in Scotland.</li>
<li>J. K. Rowling has made it known that Gilderoy Lockhart is the only character in the series to be based on a real person, and claims that she "barely exaggerated" the personality. She has refused, however, to specify who that is. Furthermore, she stated that basing the character on this man "made up for having to endure him for two solid years."<sup id="cite_ref-edinburgh_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-edinburgh-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>A rumour circulated that the character of Gilderoy Lockhart was based on J. K. Rowling's ex-husband, but this was roundly refuted on her website. She termed the rumour "toxic", "hurtful," and "damaging". Although it is not public who was the basis for Lockhart, Rowling inadvertently revealed it was not her first husband.</li>
<li>Lockhart is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Irish</a> actor <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Branagh" title="Kenneth Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>; Originally, he was to be portrayed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hugh Grant">Hugh Grant</a>, but due to scheduling problems he was replaced. One of Grant's middle names is, coincidentally, "Mungo".</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Jason_Isaacs" title="Jason Isaacs">Jason Isaacs</a> has said that he initially auditioned for the role of Lockhart before accepting the role of <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> instead.</li>
<li>Lockhart's portrayal by Kenneth Branagh in the second film are notably more likeable and comical than his book version, as he had several more moments of sincerity than his literary counterpart. This was seen when, for example, he after some time spent boasting of himself suddenly drew his wand and adopted a solemn demeanour while teaching the second years, thus showing that rather than simply using his classes to as an excuse to promote his published works like the book version did, film Lockhart at least on some level wished to make his lessons engaging for the students. Later, he wished Harry good luck in an earnest manner as Harry took the stage to duel Draco Malfoy during the duelling club, and displayed what seemed to be genuine concern and sympathy when Harry's arm was broken and, contrary to the book, seemed more concerned about mending Harry's arm than he was about the surrounding crowd seeing him do it. He was also notably and willing to clear Harry from Snape's insinuations that Harry was involved in <a href="/wiki/Mrs_Norris" title="Mrs Norris">Mrs Norris</a>' petrification, informing Snape that Harry was in detention with him. It may be because Lockhart's egotism and his most annoying treatment of Harry were toned down, but his fraudulence and willingness to let Ginny die in the Chamber of Secrets still preserves him as detestable.</li>
<li>Lockhart was in an early draft of the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, as he was in the book, but was written out of the final version. Had he remained, it would have been the first time <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Branagh" title="Kenneth Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a> and ex-wife <a href="/wiki/Emma_Thompson" title="Emma Thompson">Emma Thompson</a> were in the same film together since their divorce in 1995, along with <a href="/wiki/Helena_Bonham_Carter" title="Helena Bonham Carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a>, Branagh's former mistress.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_1-4" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</a></i>, after losing his memory, Lockhart starts making <a href="/wiki/Tea" title="Tea">tea</a>. Also, he is the only teacher who is referred to by their first name. His hair is implied on many occasions to be a wig, as it keeps nearly falling off his head.</li>
<li>As well as this, he is the only <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher to have no connection with <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> (<a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirrell</a> housed Voldemort in his head, Lupin's former friend <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> was Voldemort's spy, <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> worked for the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a> after Voldemort <a href="/wiki/Fall_of_the_Ministry_of_Magic" title="Fall of the Ministry of Magic">took it over</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Moody</a> was impersonated by a <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a>, then murdered by Voldemort and <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> was Voldemort's former Death Eater and a spy in his ranks). Lockhart has no known connection with Voldemort, because <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a> opened the Chamber of Secrets, and he never saw <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_diary" class="mw-redirect" title="Tom Riddle&#39;s diary">Riddle's diary</a>.
<ul><li>Lockhart did, however, share Voldemort's trait of wanting to be special, as he was upset to find he was not the only wizard in the world.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the video game adaption of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, it is very much evident that Lockhart is very vain as nearly the entire classroom is taken up by paintings of himself, as in the book, but it is much more exaggerated.<sup id="cite_ref-COSG_17-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COSG-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Despite being a useless teacher in the book and film adaptation, in the video games he teaches Harry some very useful spells which are important to the gameplay, such as the <a href="/wiki/Full_Body-Bind_Curse" title="Full Body-Bind Curse">Full Body-Bind Curse</a> and <a href="/wiki/Verdimillious_Duo_Spell" title="Verdimillious Duo Spell">Verdimillious Duo</a> (PS1 version), the <a href="/wiki/Tickling_Charm" title="Tickling Charm">Tickling</a> and <a href="/wiki/Softening_Charm" title="Softening Charm">Softening</a> <a href="/wiki/Charm" title="Charm">Charms</a> (PC version) and the <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Disarming Charm</a> (console versions).<sup id="cite_ref-COSG_17-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COSG-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> In the PC version, Harry mentions this in the Forbidden Forest level: "At least I learned something from Lockhart's class. Rictusempra!".</li></ul>
