A student at <a href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a>, Grindelwald was expelled for twisted, <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">dark</a> experiments and near-fatal attacks on students.  
</p><p>After leaving Durmstrang, he fostered a romantic relationship with a young Albus Dumbledore, making plans to find the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a> and lead a Wizarding revolution to end the <a href="/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy" title="International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy">International Statute of Secrecy</a>, creating a benevolent global hierarchical order led by wise and powerful witches and wizards that dominated <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggles</a>. At seventeen, their partnership fell apart after the two were involved in a three-way duel with Dumbledore's brother <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth</a> that resulted in the death of Dumbledore's sister <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana</a>.

</p><p>Grindelwald was a complex figure, highly idealistic and talented, dedicated to achieve his ends at any cost. A revolutionary operating outside the law, he and <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_army" class="mw-redirect" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s army">his followers</a> committed numerous crimes, including several murders. With violent acts in both the <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">United States</a> and <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, Grindelwald ultimately established a power base at <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard Castle</a> in Austria. In <a href="/wiki/1945" title="1945">1945</a>, at the height of Grindelwald's power, Dumbledore confronted and defeated him in <a href="/wiki/Duel_between_Albus_Dumbledore_and_Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Duel between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald">a legendary duel</a>. He was subsequently imprisoned in his own fortress for decades and was slain there by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a> when he refused to give up the location of the Elder Wand.

He was an extremely talented wizard who possessed an attractive and winsome personality, which was coupled with a "merry, wild" disposition.
</p><p>Keenly interested in history, lore, and the powerful mystique of magical artefacts, Grindelwald became fascinated with the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a>, to the point of appropriating their <a href="/wiki/Rune" title="Rune">runic</a> symbol as his own <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_mark" class="mw-redirect" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s mark">personal emblem</a> and engraving it on the walls of <a href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang</a> prior to his departure.

This was an ominous and troubling sign, as it meant that Grindelwald performed experiments that were too disturbing even for a school with a notably high tolerance of the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a>.

<p>The pair shared two preoccupations: The first was their search for the Deathly Hallows toward the goal of acquiring all three and wielding their power to become a <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Death" title="Master of Death">Master of Death</a>, which they believed to mean immortality and invincibility. They also dreamed of overturning the <a href="/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy" title="International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy">International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy</a> and creating a new order in which wise and powerful wizards and witches were the benevolent overlords of their world, including <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggles</a>. Dumbledore coined the phrase "For the Greater Good" that would be used to justify the necessary use of force required to achieve their goals, and Grindelwald would later adopt as his motto.<sup id="cite_ref-letter_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-letter-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>However, Dumbledore's motivations and intentions were different from Grindelwald's: as a young man, he had been powerless to stop a group of Muggle boys tormenting his younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana</a>, to the point that the sweet-natured girl suffered an emotional breakdown and her repressed magic became dangerously unstable. <a href="/wiki/Percival_Dumbledore" title="Percival Dumbledore">Dumbledore's father</a> was sent to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for taking revenge on the boys and his mother was killed in one of Ariana's accidents. Dumbledore wanted the power to protect his loved ones (and by extension the whole world) against cruelty and xenophobia like that shown by the Muggles. He viewed the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Stone" title="Resurrection Stone">Resurrection Stone</a> as a way of returning his parents to life and relieving him of his new familial obligations, while Grindelwald mistakenly viewed it as a tool to amass an army of <a href="/wiki/Inferius" title="Inferius">inferi</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-DH35_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH35-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Their plans to leave Godric's Hollow, acquire power, and begin their revolution turned serious. When Dumbledore's brother <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth</a> became aware of this, he was both concerned about and disgusted with Albus's ambition, knowing that he and Ariana would need to be brought along as she would not receive the care and attention she needed to keep her stable. The tense situation boiled over into a confrontation and Grindelwald, enraged, inflicted the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Aberforth. Albus moved to defend his brother, igniting a vicious three-way <a href="/wiki/Duel_at_Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Duel at Godric&#39;s Hollow">duel</a> in which Ariana was killed. Grindelwald fled the country and received putative blame for Ariana's death, thus confirming his place on the wrong side of the law and touching off his career as a Dark revolutionary, which would last until <a href="/wiki/1945" title="1945">1945</a>.

<p>In <a href="/wiki/December" title="December">December</a> of <a href="/wiki/1926" title="1926">1926</a>, unbeknownst to Picquery, Grindelwald had already infiltrated MACUSA by assuming the identity of her right-hand man <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a> using <a href="/wiki/Human_transfiguration" class="mw-redirect" title="Human transfiguration">human transfiguration,</a> whom Grindelwald managed to subdue. Grindelwald believed mysterious attacks occurring in <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York City</a> to be the work of a powerful Obscurial, which he felt would be a great asset for his plans of world domination. Using his disguise as Graves, Grindelwald came into regular contact with <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a>, believing him to be connected to the Obscurial due to a vision he received. Thinking Credence was an orphaned <a href="/wiki/Squib" title="Squib">Squib</a>, Grindelwald emotionally manipulated him into helping him find the Obscurial with the promise of protecting him from his abusive adoptive mother and teaching him magic.

<p>During this time, Grindelwald (as Graves) arrested <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a>, whose escaped beasts were believed by MACUSA to be the cause of the Obscurial's attacks. During his interrogation, Grindelwald discovered the Obscurus within <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander%27s_suitcase" title="Newton Scamander&#39;s suitcase">Newt's suitcase</a>, and in an effort to hide his tracks, had him and <a href="/wiki/Porpentina_Goldstein" title="Porpentina Goldstein">Tina Goldstein</a> sentenced to death. He then approached Credence after <a href="/wiki/Mary_Lou_Barebone" title="Mary Lou Barebone">Mary Lou Barebone</a> was killed by the Obscurial and had him track down his adoptive sister <a href="/wiki/Modesty_Barebone" title="Modesty Barebone">Modesty</a>, believing her to be the source of the Obscurus. Once they found Modesty, Grindelwald cruelly rejected Credence, as he had no further use of him. This angered Credence, who then revealed that he was the Obscurial, much to Grindelwald's surprise, as no Obscurial had survived to more than 10 years old, more than 15 years younger than Credence's age.

<p>Grindelwald wanted to use him to expose the <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North American</a> wizarding community, and create a weapon against Dumbledore. He attempted to convince Credence that he had nothing to fear anymore and to join his ranks, but this further angered Credence, who began rampaging through the city. Grindelwald was not easily deterred, however, and continued to try to recruit Credence, clashing with Tina and later Newt, both of whom he easily overpowered. When Grindelwald, Newt, and Tina were finally close to calming down Credence, Picquery and her <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> appeared on the scene and immediately attacked the Obscurus.

<p>With Credence being seemingly destroyed at the Aurors' hands, Grindelwald was so beside himself with rage that he, led by his extreme idealism, began to break his disguise while expressing his utter disgust for being forced to hide from the Muggles. Picquery subsequently ordered the other Aurors to bring "Graves" in, but Grindelwald, no longer suppressing his tremendous magical prowess, started to overwhelm them despite being outnumbered at least twenty to one. However, Newt finally managed to catch him off-guard with his <a href="/wiki/Swooping_Evil" title="Swooping Evil">Swooping Evil</a> and restrained Grindelwald's hands from behind, while Tina used a <a href="/wiki/Summoning_Charm" title="Summoning Charm">Summoning Charm</a> to take <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves%27s_wand" class="mw-redirect" title="Percival Graves&#39;s wand">Graves' wand</a>.

<p>One evening, Grindelwald called a meeting for his followers in the <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_Mausoleum" title="Lestrange Mausoleum">Lestrange Mausoleum</a>. There, he gave a rousing speech, in which he shared his idealist perspective of Muggles, as well as his vision of the future, which he warns of another great and terrible war, with images of the London Blitz and Hiroshima punctuating his rhetoric. Grindelwald, openly recognising the battalion of Aurors that had infiltrated the rally, told his followers to remain calm as he revealed their presence and invited them into the circle and he described how the Aurors have fought him so mercilessly, killing his followers simply for believing. When a <a href="/wiki/Red-haired_young_witch" title="Red-haired young witch">young witch</a>, who had been motivated by Grindelwald's speech to lash out, went for her wand, the Auror killed her in response, much to the rage of Grindelwald and the rest of the attendees. Grindelwald knelt to the girl's dead body and martyred her, asking the brave young witch to be taken back to her family. While kneeling, in Grindelwald's ignorance, Newt's Niffler, having escaped its owner's suitcase, lurked near him and stole from him a vial of blood pact protecting him from Dumbledore. After getting up from the body he commanded his followers to Disapparate from the scene while he faced off against the Aurors.

<p>When <a href="/wiki/Theseus_Scamander" title="Theseus Scamander">Theseus Scamander</a> set his men on Grindelwald, he responded by conjuring a <a href="/wiki/Protego_Diabolica" title="Protego Diabolica">circle of protective fire around himself</a>, and added an enchantment designed to test the loyalty of his followers: those who entered with complete fidelity and believed in his cause would survive; those who did not, would be engulfed and perish. Abernathy, <a href="/wiki/Vinda_Rosier" title="Vinda Rosier">Vinda Rosier</a>, Credence, and Queenie joined Grindelwald into the circle and apparated to safety, while many of the Aurors died either fleeing or fighting when Grindelwald manipulated the fire to work as a weapon as well, sending balls and bursts of black fire towards his enemies, thereby killing them. Ultimately, about half a dozen of the fifty Aurors Theseus had brought along accepted his offer and joined him in the circle as well.

<p>Eventually, the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> began just as Gellert Grindelwald foretold.

During these six years of utter chaos, Dumbledore hesitated to confront Grindelwald, despite the belief held by many, including quite possibly both men themselves, that he was the only wizard skilful enough to stop his former friend. The reason Dumbledore himself gave Harry was that he was afraid Grindelwald knew better than he did who exactly was responsible for killing Ariana and he didn't want to find out. It was also because there were difficulties in abolishing their old blood pact, which in turn prolonged the Global Wizarding War.

<p>It was speculated by <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> and Dumbledore in <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">Limbo</a> that Grindelwald had given his life to prevent Voldemort from desecrating Dumbledore's tomb, perhaps indicating that despite all that happened, Grindelwald still retained some care and respect for his old friend. Dumbledore's acknowledgement of Grindelwald's attempt to achieve redemption also indicated he believed Grindelwald was capable of changing out of some possible remaining affection for him. In the end, Grindelwald's prediction of Voldemort never fully mastering the Elder Wand would become reality, and would cause Voldemort's own demise during his final duel with Harry Potter. Although unknown, it is highly likely that after Voldemort's final defeat and the end of the Second Wizarding War, Grindelwald's assassination was exposed to the Wizarding World. It is unknown what became of his body or whether it received a proper burial or was simply disposed of.

<dd>&#8212;Dumbledore discussing Grindelwald after his death<sup class="noprint"><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">[src]</a></sup></dd>
<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>Grindelwald was a driven, charismatic, determined and brilliant individual, even in his youth. <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> himself confessed that Grindelwald was extremely charming, so much so that it had induced the former to fall in love with him, and it was partly the reason Dumbledore had been initially blind to just how dangerous Grindelwald truly was. His attraction to the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a> was not necessarily malevolent in its initial stages,<sup id="cite_ref-DH18_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH18-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> but was more of a personal interest that swelled over time in Durmstrang, a school that was rather notorious for its acceptance and study of the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts_(class)" title="Dark Arts (class)">Dark Arts</a>.
</p><p>During his formative years, Grindelwald also proved himself highly intelligent, magically talented, idealistic, as well as ambitious to the point of ruthlessness, with a ferocious temper; when <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth Dumbledore</a> challenged his and Albus's plans and tried to convince his brother to abandon them, Grindelwald "lost control" and used the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Aberforth, showing his willingness to cause pain to people who challenged him.<sup id="cite_ref-DH35_11-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH35-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Grindelwald resorted to physically striking Credence Barebone when he grew impatient with the boy, briefly shedding the soft and comforting facade that he adopted earlier. Later on, when Grindelwald duelled <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a>, he swiftly overpowered his opponent but in his rage of Newt's interference, he fiercely unleashed bolts of lightning upon the Magizoologist in order to first incapacitate him in a painful manner. After his <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_skull-hookah" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s skull-hookah">skull-hookah</a> was destroyed, Grindelwald's rage prompted him to try to destroy all of Paris. He also showed a sadistic streak, as during his battle against the Aurors in Paris, Grindelwald called after them "<i>Play by the rules. No cheating, children"</i>, shedding his charming nature entirely. Dumbledore himself expressed horror in what Grindelwald truly was, stating that he had always (unconsciously) sensed something dangerous in him. He was also not above killing Muggle infants, although he seemingly didn't like to do it, such as after arriving in Paris, Grindelwald heard the cries of a Muggle toddler, and after a brief moment of consideration, walked out of the room and left him to be murdered by <a href="/wiki/Carrow_(1920s)" title="Carrow (1920s)">one of</a> his acolytes.

<p>As a revolutionary operating outside the law, Gellert Grindelwald grew to become a man who lived in service to his ideals and, as he saw it, in humanity, and was fully convinced that his <i><a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">For the Greater Good</a></i> revolution to bring wizardkind out of hiding and "<i>rise up and take</i> [their] <i>rightful place in the world</i>", above the non-magical population, was truly <i><a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">For the Greater Good</a></i>, and would bring order, purpose, and direction to the world while providing benefits for mankind in the long run, and tirelessly endeavoured to fulfil this vision. While both willing and capable of achieving his own ends by force, he also knew better than to presume, for all his power, that he could take on the whole world by himself and possibly come out on top. As such, he relied equally much on his outstandingly genius-level intellect and excellent mastery in the use of tactics and strategy. Aside from his ability to create carefully-woven plans to achieve his goals, Grindelwald was incredibly clever and composed, as well as an extremely persuasive orator; he had a phenomenal command of the art of public speaking, allowing him to mystify and terrify his audiences, allies and enemies alike, inspiring fanatical loyalty with each word, and gaining widespread <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_army" class="mw-redirect" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s army">following</a> for his <a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">cause</a>, followers whom he affectionately referred to as his as "brothers and sisters" and called "friends". When appearing in front of an audience at a rally, Grindelwald was treated as a revered celebrity, as was expected of someone with his charisma.

<p>He did recognise, however, that while a brilliant wizard, he was not infallible, and thus Grindelwald openly confided in a carefully selected group of six <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_acolytes" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s acolytes">Acolytes</a> that constituted the innermost circle of the army of Dark witches and wizards that he marshalled to his side. Additionally, while escaping his <a href="/wiki/Incarceration_Carriage" title="Incarceration Carriage">Incarceration Carriage</a> and killing all of the accompanying <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a>, Grindelwald went out of his way to let <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_Spielman" title="Rudolph Spielman">Rudolph Spielman</a> live, seemingly in order for the frightened <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Incarceration" title="Head of Incarceration">Head of Incarceration</a> to tell the <a href="/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Wizards" title="International Confederation of Wizards">International Confederation of Wizards</a> how great of a threat Grindelwald truly was. Grindelwald could also work very independently when he had to, however, such as when he seemingly single-handedly infiltrated the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a>, and was able to mimic the personality of <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a> for an extended period time without arousing suspicion — even when having his followers denounced as fanatics by Newton Scamander, Grindelwald was mostly unfazed and only chuckled the only time he truly aroused anyone's suspicion was when he interrogated <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a> and labelled the hostless <a href="/wiki/Obscurus" title="Obscurus">Obscurus</a> as "useless", which roused Newt to angry disbelief, and appeared to baffle former Auror Tina Goldstein. Thus, Grindelwald either momentarily lapsed in his facade at this point, or incorporated his own ruthlessness and calculative nature into that of Percival Graves. Either way, Grindelwald was quick enough to quell Newt's realisation by sentencing both him and Tina to death, before the conversation could go any further.
</p><p>Grindelwald showed himself to be immensely charismatic — he effortlessly exploited <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a> by appealing to the boy in a way nobody else tried to and offering to accept the boy into his ranks. Even after it became clear that Credence, as an <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">Obscurial</a>, was extremely powerful and phenomenally dangerous, Grindelwald calmly continued to try and exploit him, and was outraged when the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> President opted to have her <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> seemingly destroy him. Grindelwald was idealistic to an extreme,<sup id="cite_ref-Daily_News_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Daily_News-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> having absolutely no complaints about the murder of hundreds of innocent people as long as that accomplished his long-term goals. Indeed, Grindelwald's idealism even prompted him to truly break his disguise in New York, expressing his disgust for being forced to hide from Muggles, and then proceeding to attack the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> Aurors who had seemingly killed Credence. Even then, however, his anger was not expressed on his own behalf, but rather on that of the cause he was fighting for, which more or less spurred his life and deeds. Grindelwald spoke scornfully towards <a href="/wiki/Seraphina_Picquery" title="Seraphina Picquery">President Picquery</a> when she insisted the Obscurial's destruction was on her orders, mocking the fact that history would note this, and that it wasn't right. Grindelwald noticeably paused before engaging the Aurors, indicating that he couldn't see any other way out of it. Throughout all of this, Grindelwald maintained a stern pride in his own skill: even as he was unexpectedly apprehended by the Aurors after Newt Scamander had attacked and subdued him from behind, Grindelwald was unfazed, and simply questioned President Picquery's ability to contain a wizard of his reputation and power. He did not even blink when faced with the President, fixing her with a fierce stare until she was out of his sight, showing his unwillingness to show fear to his enemies.

<p>As shown at his <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> rally, Grindelwald inspired fanatical loyalty in attendees by praising <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">Wizardkind</a> for being "rare souls", and only labelled tyrannical Muggles as the true enemy, claiming that what he and his <i><a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">For the Greater Good</a></i> revolution were actually opposing was the future <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> that the Muggles would start, and that it was the <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a>, rather than his <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_acolytes" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s acolytes">Acolytes</a> who were the truly violent wizards. Indeed, Grindelwald even persuaded the peaceful, kind, and compassionate <a href="/wiki/Queenie_Goldstein" title="Queenie Goldstein">Queenie Goldstein</a> to join his cause by promising to abolish such laws as <a href="/wiki/Rappaport%27s_Law" title="Rappaport&#39;s Law">Rappaport's Law</a>, thus promising to bring Queenie and others a newfound freedom to love whomever they please. Grindelwald also showed a great trust in his followers, as seen by his trusting <a href="/wiki/Vinda_Rosier" title="Vinda Rosier">Vinda Rosier</a> and his other <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_acolytes" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s acolytes">Acolytes</a> to "spread the word" of his ideology across the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">Wizarding world</a>. Grindelwald was extremely persuasive even in his time in prison, where he kept convincing his jailers to join his side, forcing the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> to change his guards three times, and to cut out Grindelwald's tongue.
</p><p>He demonstrated his manipulative skills and the willingness to use them for his own purposes. Judging by <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth Dumbledore</a>'s testimony, Grindelwald had little interest in, or patience with, those he considered beneath him. He considered <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> an equal, and praised the tremendous potential of the <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">Obscurial</a> <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a>, for instance, but was dismissive of the less talented and intelligent Aberforth, the permanently damaged <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana</a>, and also, initially, Credence, whom Grindelwald initially callously discarded when he seemingly became no longer useful, mistakenly believing Credence to be a <a href="/wiki/Squib" title="Squib">Squib</a>, whom it would be impossible to magically train. In addition, while disguised as <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a>, Grindelwald questioned <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a>, who he seemingly found to be an average wizard, in an interrogation as to why Dumbledore would have such faith in Newt, indicating an interest in further understanding both Dumbledore and Newt's abilities. Grindelwald's dismissal of Credence as a Squib suggested that Grindelwald, in his (somewhat arrogant) awareness of his own brilliance, was so secure in his own <a href="/wiki/Seer" title="Seer">Seer</a> judgement as to having grown a weakness for jumping to conclusions. Grindelwald was also criticised by Newt for deeming magical creatures too simple to raise his interest, being only turned towards more complex forms of magic, unaware that one such creature, a <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Niffler</a>, actually stole his <a href="/wiki/Blood_pact" title="Blood pact">Blood pact</a> vial. 
</p><p>However, Grindelwald was ultimately not a complete amoral man, as shown by how he was capable of feeling remorse for past wrongdoings and the fact that his lengths he was willing to go to reach his goals were fuelled by ambition and a fanatical sense of self-purpose, rather than evil intent. Grindelwald's decision to stun, not kill <a href="/wiki/Mykew_Gregorovitch" title="Mykew Gregorovitch">Gregorovitch</a>, when he acquired the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a> from the latter, and also not bother finishing off <a href="/wiki/Porpentina_Goldstein" title="Porpentina Goldstein">Porpentina Goldstein</a> even though he could have easily did it, hints at a willingness not to kill simply as a matter of course. However, this might have been a calculated decision, perhaps considering that people were more likely to give credence to Gregorovitch's claims that he'd had the Elder Wand if he was murdered, as that was the traditional method of passing it on,<sup id="cite_ref-DH18_19-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH18-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> while his sparing of Tina was likely because Grindelwald didn't view her worth the time he could instead have used to try to persuade Credence. After all, Grindelwald killed his own pet <a href="/wiki/Chupacabra" title="Chupacabra">Chupacabra</a> <a href="/wiki/Antonio" title="Antonio">Antonio</a> after deeming him "too needy", he killed numerous <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> while escaping the MACUSA, he ruthlessly killed many people who did not display enough loyalty to him to enter his <a href="/wiki/Protego_Diabolica" title="Protego Diabolica">circle of blue fire</a> (disintegrating his own inadequately loyal Acolyte <a href="/wiki/Krall" title="Krall">Krall</a>, although while he did not spare Krall, he sombrely closed his eyes, indicating some regret and remorse, at seeing Krall painfully die as he tried to reach out to him as he reached out to Grindelwald, in addition to also offering the Aurors who attacked him a chance to join his army rather than just simply immediately massacring all of them and when Leta Lestrange asked him to stop, Grindelwald seemed rather willing to spare Newt and Theseus had Leta joined him, having stopped his attempts to burn them alive and only having the black flames thwart them instead of killing them), and Grindelwald even had no objections to <a href="/wiki/Vinda_Rosier" title="Vinda Rosier">Vinda Rosier</a> and <a href="/wiki/Carrow_(1920s)" title="Carrow (1920s)">Carrow</a> murdering a family of <a href="/wiki/Muggle" class="mw-redirect" title="Muggle">Non-Magiques</a>, including their infant son, to secure a temporary headquarters for the Acolytes in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, although he seemed a bit reluctant in killing the baby and chose not to witness his acolytes kill him.
</p><p>Nonetheless, Grindelwald's ideology was considerably less extreme than that of Voldemort - while he considered his own wizarding kind superior, Grindelwald's intended new world order only seemed to oppose tyrannical and hateful non-magical individuals, such as the No-Maj <a href="/wiki/New_Salem_Philanthropic_Society" title="New Salem Philanthropic Society">Second Salemers</a>, and the Muggle executors of the future atrocities of the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>. Whereas Voldemort genuinely desired the destruction of all non-magic individuals, Grindelwald only ever wanted to subjugate them, believing that the beast of burden would always be necessary.  
</p><p>Proof of his lesser dark nature, when compared to that of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, was how that while Voldemort was completely without empathy and unable to feel remorse, Grindelwald seemed to genuinely pity Credence for the greatly unjust treatment he was exposed to not only by his own mother, but also by the magical community, as displayed by his rage of Credence being destroyed by MACUSA. He later expressed sympathy for how <a href="/wiki/Mary_Lou_Barebone" title="Mary Lou Barebone">Mary Lou Barebone</a> had nearly destroyed her own adopted son. After many years of imprisonment in <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard</a>, as he sat alone in his former fortress, Grindelwald was reportedly known for having contemplated his past misdeeds and felt remorse and shame for the horrifying things he had committed during his attempted rise to power over the magical and non-magical worlds. This clearly influenced his decision to hide the location of the Elder Wand from Voldemort, despite being confronted and certainly about to die at the hands of the only Dark Wizard more powerful and dangerous than himself, which Dumbledore acknowledged to be out of a desire to achieve a shred of redemption. This remorse and redemption is in stark contrast to Voldemort, who showed not an ounce of remorse for the countless atrocities he committed.
</p><p>Grindelwald was also proven to be capable of fear, judging from the fact that he fled in fear of his life after the intense duel between himself, Dumbledore, and Aberforth that resulted in Ariana's death, and how he resorted to being more cautious around Credence upon realising that <i>he</i> was the Obscurial (in the knowledge of how dangerous and volatile Obscurials were). He never attempted to extend his power to Britain for fear of facing Dumbledore (most likely due to the circumstances of their last encounter, and the fact that he recognised how powerful Dumbledore was), but notably also due to their <a href="/wiki/Blood_pact" title="Blood pact">Blood pact</a> making Grindelwald unable to directly confront Dumbledore. Not only does this suggest that Grindelwald was actually capable of contemplating Dumbledore being equivalently powerful or dangerous as himself, but that he was also capable of respecting Dumbledore. It would seem that despite Dumbledore being the cause of his downfall, Grindelwald still genuinely considered Dumbledore his friend in the end to an extent, as Harry Potter noted Grindelwald had also intended to prevent Dumbledore's tomb from being desecrated when he lied on the Elder Wand. It should also be noted that despite his claims of wanting to unleash Credence upon Dumbledore, Grindelwald was never known to attack Britain even after he had Credence, as Britain was always acknowledged as the only place safe from Grindelwald, which seemed to imply Grindelwald, even at his worst, did not want Albus dead unless he had interfered in his plans.
</p><p>When trapped and unarmed in <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard</a>, facing certain death at the hands of the only dark wizard more powerful than himself, Lord Voldemort, Grindelwald was openly defiant towards him, even mocking, goading Voldemort into killing him by saying that he welcomed death, but that it would not "bring him what [he] <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">sought</a>", saying there is so much he "doesn't understand". Indeed, he seemed to exhibit a grotesque remnant of the "merry, wild" temperament of his youth. Grindelwald's last words consisted of the dressing-down of Voldemort, and a rather enthusiastic outlook on <a href="/wiki/Afterlife" title="Afterlife">"the next great adventure"</a>, all of which seems clear in its connection to his old flame, Albus Dumbledore.

<dd></dd></dl></div><p>Grindelwald was an outstandingly talented <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a> even in his youth while still a student. As an adult, Grindelwald became a very powerful and accomplished wizard and was admired and feared by many others of outstanding magical talent. Indeed, it is not without good reason that Grindelwald went down in history as among the most dangerous <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizards</a> of all time, maintaining the top spot for a long period of time until the arrival of the even more powerful <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, who earned the top title on the list a generation later. Indeed, even <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, who was considered by many to be the greatest wizard of all time and whose past friendship with him meant that he knew Grindelwald better than arguably any living person, acknowledged that Grindelwald was nearly as brilliant as himself, with Dumbledore describing himself as a shade more skilful. As a former master of the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>, Grindelwald's already formidable abilities was further enhanced by the artefact's legendary powers, allowing him to perform spells that would be more powerful than otherwise magically possible.
</p><ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">Magical</a> mastery</b>: Grindelwald was noted to be very talented and skilled while still a student of <a href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a>, and acknowledged later in life to have been on par with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, with their magical and intellectual prowess being so complimentary to one another that it induced the two young men to quickly befriend one another in their youth. By the mid- <a href="/wiki/1920s" title="1920s">1920s</a>, the immensity of Grindelwald's power were already clearly evident, having proven himself to be easily capable of overcoming any obstacle presented to him by witches and wizards trying to to end his reign of terror, to the point where even <a href="/wiki/Torquil_Travers" title="Torquil Travers">Torquil Travers</a> of the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, despite his personal dislike of the man, reluctantly had to acknowledged that the Albus Dumbledore was the only wizard alive who could stand any chance of defeating Grindelwald. By the time of what unbeknownst to Grindelwald himself would soon become the dawn of the <a href="/wiki/Global_wizarding_war" title="Global wizarding war">Global wizarding war</a>, much of the international wizarding communities had come to concur with him, pleading for Dumbledore to take action. At the time, the evolutionary leader in question had successfully <a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">terrorised</a> much of the wizarding world and had a huge number of <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_army" class="mw-redirect" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s army">followers</a> at his command. Indeed, Dumbledore himself recalled that the height of Grindelwald's power was such that it would have been "<i>too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable</i>", which ultimately prompted Professor Dumbledore to finally put aside his personal feelings and fears, and to finally seek out his old flame to put an end to his reign of terror once and for all. Grindelwald was ultimately defeated by Albus, though it must be noted that according to contemporary accounts, their displays of power and skill was of a standard that few had ever seen before in the history of wizardkind, and their <a href="/wiki/Duel_between_Albus_Dumbledore_and_Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Duel between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald">famous duel</a> in <a href="/wiki/1945" title="1945">1945</a> went down in history as one of the greatest duels ever fought between two wizards.</li>
<li><b>Intellectual genius</b>: Grindelwald was not only a great wizard, but also possessed a tremendous level of intellect, considered by most to be almost as brilliant as <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>. Indeed, Grindelwald and Dumbledore's intellects were so complementary to one another that according to <a href="/wiki/Bathilda_Bagshot" title="Bathilda Bagshot">Bathilda Bagshot</a>, even after spending an entire day in intellectually stimulating discussions with Grindelwald, Dumbledore would still unexpectedly send Grindelwald messages by owl right after sudden ideas struck him, with him having to let Grindelwald know of them immediately.<sup id="cite_ref-DH18_19-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH18-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>​​ As an adult, Grindelwald became an exceptional strategist and tactician, whose expertise was perhaps best shown by his ability to start a massive <a href="/wiki/Global_wizarding_war" title="Global wizarding war">revolution</a> on his own, gathering a large amount of <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_army" class="mw-redirect" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s army">followers</a> to establish a new wizarding world order, and strategically overwhelming much of the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">Wizarding world</a> to the point that Dumbledore's tactical advice ultimately proved fruitless, requiring Dumbledore's direct intervention to finally put an end to his <i><a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">For the Greater Good</a></i> revolution. Examples of Grindelwald's uncanny ability to create complex and carefully-woven plans to achieve his goals was shown, among others, when he managed to think his way out of his <a href="/wiki/Blood_pact" title="Blood pact">blood pact</a> with Dumbledore by formulating a master plan to investigate the Obscurial attack on <a href="/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> unhindered, with the intent of using the <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">Obscurial</a> in question as a lethal weapon again his former friend. This he accomplished when he removed <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America">President</a> <a href="/wiki/Seraphina_Picquery" title="Seraphina Picquery">Picquery</a>'s right-hand man, <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a>, from the playing field, and infiltrated the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> by assuming his identity. Grindelwald also proved to be a consummate actor, multitasker and investigator, as during his time disguised as Graves, Grindelwald was able to perfectly mimic his personality and American accent, and limit his magical abilities to be only on par with Graves, as well as convincingly and effectively carry out Graves' many duties, while also gradually managing to locate the rampaging <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">Obscurial</a>, all without arousing suspicion. Grindelwald demonstrated his brilliance yet again when he orchestrated an escape plan cunning enough to outwit even the experience of <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_Spielman" title="Rudolph Spielman">Rudolph Spielman</a>, whose position as <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Incarceration" title="Head of Incarceration">Head of Incarceration</a> meant he was accustomed to dealing with highly dangerous criminals. Grindelwald was also fully aware of and highly excelled in taking advantage of the discontent of those members of the Wizarding World that harboured anti-Muggle sentiments, presenting a strong case for his <a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">cause</a>, and did so in a way that was not only very appealing to the <a href="/wiki/Alliance" title="Alliance">target audience</a>, but also simultaneously succeeded in inspiring an "<i>us versus them</i>" mentality in those inclined to support him towards the <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> of the world that fought against him, whom he presented as something akin to psychopathic soldiers of the current <a href="/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Wizards" title="International Confederation of Wizards">ruling class</a>, employed by its <a href="/wiki/Category:Magical_governments" title="Category:Magical governments">underlings</a> to suppress them if they dared to disagree with the <a href="/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy" title="International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy">status quo</a>, and did so in a way that made any Auror trying to attack him or one of his supporters appear to confirm his claims to the rest of them. During his <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> rally, Grindelwald succeeded in convincing almost all of the many attendees to join his cause, who immediately went to spread his propaganda across the wizarding world at his behest, after a young British Auror in <a href="/wiki/Theseus_Scamander" title="Theseus Scamander">Theseus Scamander</a>'s squad killed <a href="/wiki/Unidentified_red-haired_witch" title="Unidentified red-haired witch">one of them</a>.</li>
<li><b>Charisma</b>: Even as a young man, Grindelwald was highly talented in manipulating and inspiring others, such that he was able to manipulate the extremely intelligent and perceptive <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> into agreeing to accompany him as he embarked on his revolutionary endeavour to overthrow the <a href="/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy" title="International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy">International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy</a>, halted only by Aberforth's timely intervention. As an adult, Grindelwald's skills in manipulating others grew even further, with <a href="/wiki/Theseus_Scamander" title="Theseus Scamander">Theseus Scamander</a> describing him as a "charismatic blighter", and Grindelwald successfully convincing numerous wizards and witches to join his cause during rallies, to the point where he would receive a standing ovation at his <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> rally for simply making a "public" appearance, being hailed as a hero by his fanatical followers. Grindelwald was also able to effortlessly manipulate <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a> into trusting him, doing so by playing the role of a kind mentor to Credence after assuming the identity of <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a>, to the point that Credence was completely unaware that Grindelwald was merely using him. He was also shown to be confident that he could eventually get Credence in his <a href="/wiki/Obscurus" title="Obscurus">Obscurus</a> form to listen to him, which made him enraged when he was seemingly destroyed by MACUSA Aurors. Indeed, Grindelwald was ultimately even able to manipulate the young man to his side by presenting himself as the only one who could give him the answers he wanted, and finally gifting Credence with a proper wand, thus finally succeeding in earning his full confidence. Grindelwald was even able to persuade the kind-hearted and compassionate <a href="/wiki/Queenie_Goldstein" title="Queenie Goldstein">Queenie Goldstein</a> to join his ranks, by promising to provide Queenie with the freedom to love and marry <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Kowalski" title="Jacob Kowalski">Jacob Kowalski</a>, as well as to provide that freedom to others. An outstanding orator, Grindelwald could charm a fanatical following in hundreds of people at once, to the point that he trusted his new followers to "spread the word" of his ideology across the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">Wizarding world</a>. During his time in prison, the MACUSA was forced to cut out Grindelwald's tongue, as he kept convincing his jailers to join his side, notably thus swaying the formerly loyal MACUSA employee <a href="/wiki/Abernathy" title="Abernathy">Abernathy</a>. Indeed, only people with truly incorruptible moral codes, or with a full acceptance of their past sins, were able to resist Grindelwald's charisma.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Leadership skills</b>: Confident in his own abilities and secure in his own judgement, Grindelwald was a very self-assured individual, and his considerable abilities and brilliant mind both allowed Grindelwald to become a greatly inspiring revolutionary leader. ​​During his younger days, he felt certain that together, he and Dumbledore could start his revolution to conquer the wizarding and non-wizarding worlds. As an adult, Grindelwald proved his leadership by raising and leading a vast army of followers during his <i><a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">For the Greater Good</a></i> revolution to establish a new wizarding order. So effectively, in fact, that Grindelwald successfully sparked the <a href="/wiki/Global_wizarding_war" title="Global wizarding war">Global wizarding war</a> across much of the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">Wizarding world</a>, and very nearly conquered the magical community, to the point that <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> ultimately saw the need to personally confront him. While disguised as <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a>, Grindelwald demonstrated his leadership again by taking over the latter's high-ranking positions in the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> as the Head of the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement_(MACUSA)" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement (MACUSA)">Department of Magical Law Enforcement</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Director_of_Magical_Security" title="Director of Magical Security">Director of Magical Security</a>, doing so for an extended period of time without even <a href="/wiki/Seraphina_Picquery" title="Seraphina Picquery">President Picquery</a> suspecting anything.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Magical_Law" title="Magical Law">Magical Law</a> expertise</b>: Grindelwald was highly knowledgeable in the laws of the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">Wizarding world</a>, as shown by his success impersonating <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a> as the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. This was also evident in Grindelwald's consummate knowledge of the <a href="/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy" title="International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy">International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy</a>, and his ability to very effectively exploit the sacred law's weaknesses, and rebel against it. In addition, Grindelwald had a decent degree of understanding and knowledge of the <a href="/wiki/Rappaport%27s_Law" title="Rappaport&#39;s Law">Rappaport's Law</a> and thus used said knowledge to great effect to successfully convince Queenie Goldstein to join him despite her lovable and peaceful personality, as Grindelwald took advantage of Queenie's desperation to be with Jacob, as Jacob being a No Maj cannot be with Queenie with said law in effect to persuade her he will allow her to be with him by abolishing the law after his revolution was successful.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a></b>: Grindelwald was incredibly proficient and talented in the Dark Arts, and became the most dangerous <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizard</a> of the early <a href="/wiki/20th_century" title="20th century">20th century</a> and maintained a well-deserved spot at the top of the list of the <a href="/wiki/Most_Dangerous_Dark_Wizards_of_All_Time" title="Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time">Most Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time</a>, until he was surpassed with the arrival of the even more powerful <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> a generation later.. Even as a student, Grindelwald's talents were already great enough that, coupled with his passion for the Dark Arts, his exploration and practice of such magic were already very dangerous, even nearly fatal to the fellow Durmstrang students, and eventually, his "twisted experiments" became too dangerous for even Dumstrang's tolerant outlook on the Dark Arts, resulting in his expulsion.<sup id="cite_ref-DH18_19-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH18-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>​​ While seventeen, Grindelwald was already adept at casting the extremely powerful Cruciatus Curse, notably using it against Aberforth Dumbledore.<sup id="cite_ref-DH28_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH28-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> While impersonating Percival Graves and duelling <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a>, Grindelwald used an <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_lightning_bolt_curse" class="mw-redirect" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s lightning bolt curse">unknown curse</a> that unleashed fissures of force and another that emitted a bolt of lightning to torture him. During <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_Paris_rally" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s Paris rally">Battle in the Lestrange Mausoleum</a> of <a href="/wiki/1927" title="1927">1927</a>, Grindelwald <a href="/wiki/Protego_Diabolica" title="Protego Diabolica">conjured an incredibly powerful protective ring of cursed fire</a>, which he was able to manipulate to an extraordinary degree, effectively turning the defensive spell into a devastating weapon, easily killing most of the fifty Aurors present, some even in mid- <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Apparition</a>. He also nearly killing Newt and Theseus with a concentrated burst of the flames, as well greatly spread it around upon being angered by Leta's destruction of his Skull-Hookah, with said flames serving as a magical protection of sorts, easily repelling Theseus's attempts to stop Grindelwald from killing his fiancée. Grindelwald was even able to shape it into a huge winged fiery demon of such potency that it was capable of potentially destroying all of <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, requiring the combined efforts of <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel" title="Nicolas Flamel">Nicholas Flamel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Theseus_Scamander" title="Theseus Scamander">Theseus Scamander</a>, <a href="/wiki/Porpentina_Goldstein" title="Porpentina Goldstein">Tina Goldstein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Yusuf_Kama" title="Yusuf Kama">Yusuf Kama</a> to dispel it.</li>

This was demonstrated when Grindelwald posed as <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a>, who was an extremely skilled <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Director_of_Magical_Security" title="Director of Magical Security">Director of Magical Security</a> with therefore undeniably great skills in safeguarding the North American wizarding community against the Dark Arts and perfectly imitated Graves's defensive expertise without arousing the suspicion of even <a href="/wiki/Seraphina_Picquery" title="Seraphina Picquery">President Picquery</a>. Moreover, Grindelwald proved quite capable of using non-dark <a href="/wiki/Martial_magic" title="Martial magic">martial magic</a> to devastating effect, as shown by how he could cast <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">Stunning Spells</a> strong enough to instantly knock out targets and also use <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">Shield Charms</a> of massive size capable of repelling a coordinated attacks from about thirty seasoned Aurors with relative ease.<figure class="thumb tright show-info-icon" style="width: 252px"> 	<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/0/0a/GrindelPower.gif/revision/latest?cb=20190325194146" class="image"><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" width="250" height="105" class="thumbimage lazyload" data-image-name="GrindelPower.gif" data-image-key="GrindelPower.gif" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/0/0a/GrindelPower.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20190325194146" /></a> 	<noscript><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/0/0a/GrindelPower.gif/revision/latest?cb=20190325194146" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/0/0a/GrindelPower.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20190325194146" decoding="async" width="250" height="105" class="thumbimage" data-image-name="GrindelPower.gif" data-image-key="GrindelPower.gif" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/0/0a/GrindelPower.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20190325194146" /></a></noscript> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> 		 			<a href="/wiki/File:GrindelPower.gif" class="info-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> 		 		 		 			<p class="caption">Grindelwald dessimating <a href="/wiki/Theseus_Scamander" title="Theseus Scamander">Theseus Scamander</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">men</a></p> 		 	</figcaption> </figure></li>
<li><b>Elemental magic mastery</b>: Much like his former friend <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, Grindelwald was extremely accomplished with the manipulation of the elements. When fighting off five European Aurors, Grindelwald unleashed a huge white fiery blast that incinerated them in an instant. In his brief duel with <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a>, Grindelwald generated shock-waves of blue lightning that quickly knocked down Newt, before using the same spell to torture him. While escaping his flying <a href="/wiki/Incarceration_Carriage" title="Incarceration Carriage">Incarceration Carriage</a>, Grindelwald blasted massive lightning bolts to dispatch the handful of broomstick-mounted Aurors tasked with escorting it, and then easily manipulated the waters of the Hudson River to flood the carriage, nearly drowning all those inside. Moreover, following his rally, Grindelwald was able to conjure an incredibly powerful <a href="/wiki/Protego_Diabolica" title="Protego Diabolica">ring of black fire</a> that he was able to manipulate to cast columns of <a href="/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a> fast enough to reach Aurors in mid-Apparition and also shape into a fiery winged demon capable of destroying all of Paris.<figure class="thumb tright show-info-icon" style="width: 272px"> 	<a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/e9/Grindelwald_fighting_Aurors.gif/revision/latest?cb=20190325022344" class="image"><img alt="" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D" decoding="async" width="270" height="113" class="thumbimage lazyload" data-image-name="Grindelwald fighting Aurors.gif" data-image-key="Grindelwald_fighting_Aurors.gif" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/e9/Grindelwald_fighting_Aurors.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20190325022344" /></a> 	<noscript><a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/e9/Grindelwald_fighting_Aurors.gif/revision/latest?cb=20190325022344" class="image"><img alt="" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/e9/Grindelwald_fighting_Aurors.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20190325022344" decoding="async" width="270" height="113" class="thumbimage" data-image-name="Grindelwald fighting Aurors.gif" data-image-key="Grindelwald_fighting_Aurors.gif" data-src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/e9/Grindelwald_fighting_Aurors.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20190325022344" /></a></noscript> 	<figcaption class="thumbcaption"> 		 			<a href="/wiki/File:Grindelwald_fighting_Aurors.gif" class="info-icon"><svg><use xlink:href="#wds-icons-info-small"></use></svg></a> 		 		 		 			<p class="caption">Gellert Grindelwald duelling MACUSA Aurors</p> 		 	</figcaption> </figure></li></ul>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">Duelling</a></b>: Gellert Grindelwald was a duellist of extraordinary skill. Even as a teenager, Grindelwald was already highly proficient in magical combat, having received thorough training in duelling and all manner of <a href="/wiki/Martial_magic" title="Martial magic">martial magic</a> during his schooling at Durmstrang Institute. Able to hone his skills to match his potential, Grindelwald became a fully confident, focused, disciplined and versatile practitioner of combative spellwork. In his late teens, he held his own against <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus</a> and <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth Dumbledore</a> simultaneously during their three-way duel at Godric's Hallow, and later ​​​​​effortlessly won the Elder Wand from its previous master, <a href="/wiki/Mykew_Gregorovitch" title="Mykew Gregorovitch">Mykew Gregorovitch</a>, with a single stunning spell when he stole it from his <a href="/wiki/Gregorovitch_Zauberst%C3%A4be" title="Gregorovitch Zauberstäbe">workshop</a>. As an adult, he earned a fearful reputation defeated and killed many powerful witches and wizards during his reign of terror in wizarding world. Though quite capable of performing magic of great destructive power, as seen in the <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_Paris_rally" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s Paris rally">Battle in the Lestrange Mausoleum</a>, he would sometimes prefer to engage his adversaries in a more traditional and formal manner of combat. When he did this, he could display a surprisingly defensive duelling style, deflecting his opponents' efforts with perfect ease and slowly advancing upon them before delivering the crushing blow, in order to take in the awe with which they observed the immensity of his power, but when duelling Newt Scamander, Grindelwald also used an aggressive duelling style, only once defending and constantly attacking his opponent. He also presumably overpowered Percival Graves, so he could disguise himself as him and infiltrate MACUSA. While impersonating Graves, Grindelwald still displayed considerable skill. Upon being unmasked, Grindelwald not only fended off many MACUSA Aurors simultaneously, seamlessly switching between offence and defence to both repel and attack his opponents, but he also quickly started to overwhelm them, until Newt intervened and restrained him from behind. Grindelwald later single-handedly escaped from captivity, defeating many broomstick-mounted Aurors, and took control of the <a href="/wiki/Incarceration_Carriage" title="Incarceration Carriage">Incarceration Carriage</a>. Later, he overcame the combined might of Theseus himself, as well as the highly skilled Tina Goldstein, Newt Scamander and <a href="/wiki/Leta_Lestrange" title="Leta Lestrange">Leta Lestrange</a>, the latter of whom he killed. During his reign of terror, Albus Dumbledore was considered by the British Ministry of Magic to be the only duelist capable of overpowering and capturing Grindelwald alone and, at the height of his power, the only one who could defeat him, with much of the wizarding world pleading with Dumbledore to confront him. Indeed, although he was ultimately defeated by him, their duel went down in history as among the greatest ever fought between two wizards.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Charm" title="Charm">Charms</a></b>: Grindelwald was extremely skilled in charm-work. Albus Dumbledore noted that both he and Grindelwald could already effectively render themselves invisible without needing to use an <a href="/wiki/Invisibility_cloak" title="Invisibility cloak">invisibility cloak</a> during their late teens, possibly with the <a href="/wiki/Disillusionment_Charm" title="Disillusionment Charm">Disillusionment Charm</a>, which is a tremendous feat. This made the <a href="/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility" title="Cloak of Invisibility">Cloak of Invisibility</a> the Hallow that Grindelwald was least interested in, though he continued his search for it only because the Cloak completed the trio of legendary artefacts. Grindelwald also enchanted a necklace with the symbol of <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a>, a necklace that he gave to <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence</a>, so that the latter could summon him by touching it. Later, Grindelwald used the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a> to project images of Credence and the <a href="/wiki/Obscurus" title="Obscurus">Obscurus</a>. Grindelwald skill was such that he could cast several minor spells both non-verbally and wandlessly to a great effect: disarming Newt and Tina and summoning their wands, as well as Newt's case to him, before levitating them alongside Jacob, and slamming them down; summoning the magical orb containing the Obscurus from Newt's case; levitating Credence away and even levitating and throwing a car, all with mere gestures. Grindelwald later instantly made the wands of the Aurors inside his <a href="/wiki/Incarceration_Carriage" title="Incarceration Carriage">Incarceration Carriage</a> reverse direction and hover dangerously in front of their owners throats. He took down several Aurors following him with the <a href="/wiki/Tempest_Jinx" title="Tempest Jinx">Tempest Jinx</a>, and effortlessly unlocked the door to the Incarceration Carriage. Grindelwald also displayed phenomenal mastery over the <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">Shield Charm</a>, capable of instantly conjuring up massive magical shields with ease. Indeed, Grindelwald's Shield Charm was powerful enough to repel a barrage of spells fired at him by around thirty trained Aurors simultaneously without fail. After his rally, Grindelwald also drew up an incredibly powerful protective ring of fire around himself, which he proceeded to bewitch so that only those truly loyal to him and his cause could pass through it unscathed, with those insufficiently loyal to him, such as <a href="/wiki/Krall" title="Krall">Krall</a>, instead disintegrating from the fire. While disguised as Graves, Grindelwald locked the door to his office with a powerful charm that Queenie was not able to break. In addition, he was able to brand Dumstrang with his symbol and enchant it to make it forever irremovable, even after his death. He could also at least conjure a non-corporeal <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-LEGOY2_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LEGOY2-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> despite being a dark wizard.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a></b>: Grindelwald was fairly knowledgeable and adept on handling magical <a href="/wiki/Creature" title="Creature">creatures</a>, particularly dark ones, having managed to tame the baby <a href="/wiki/Chupacabra" title="Chupacabra">Chupacabra</a> placed in his cell to guard him by the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">Magical Congress of the United States of America</a> and had even named it. In fact, the affection and loyalty Grindelwald had inspired in said creature was such that it attacked <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_Spielman" title="Rudolph Spielman">Rudolph Spielman</a>, whom it recognised as Grindelwald's enemy, while leaving Grindelwald's follower, <a href="/wiki/Abernathy" title="Abernathy">Abernathy</a>, alone. Grindelwald was also able to recognise a baby bird as a <a href="/wiki/Phoenix" title="Phoenix">Phoenix</a>, and, with his awareness of the legend of a Phoenix coming to the aid of a Dumbledore in need, Grindelwald managed to persuade <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a> that the latter was actually Aurelius Dumbledore, somehow quickly accelerating the Phoenix's growth in the process. Grindelwald also had no problems mounting the <a href="/wiki/Thestral" title="Thestral">Thestrals</a> of his <a href="/wiki/Incarceration_Carriage" title="Incarceration Carriage">Incarceration Carriage</a>, directing them, while simultaneously defeating many broomstick-mounted <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a>. However, as expert <a href="/wiki/Magizoologist" title="Magizoologist">Magizoologist</a> <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a> noted, Grindelwald did not bother to train himself to be an expert in handling simple magical creatures due to being more tuned towards complex forms of magic, which is how Newt was able to use his <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Niffler</a> to steal Grindelwald's <a href="/wiki/Blood_pact" title="Blood pact">Blood pact</a> vial without him noticing.</li></ul>

However, when he had a <a href="/wiki/Vision" title="Vision">vision</a> about the existence of a powerful <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">Obscurial</a> linked to <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a>, Grindelwald initially misinterpreted his vision, believing that Credence would lead him to the Obscurial child while in fact, Credence was the Obscurial himself. However, it should be noted that he had not anticipated such a miraculous thing happening as Credence is the only known Obscurial ever to have survived past the age of ten. He would also rely on <a href="/wiki/Astrology" title="Astrology">Astrology</a>, and use the relative positions of celestial bodies to try and gain further insight into future events, possibly in an effort to pinpoint at what point in time his <a href="/wiki/Prophecy" title="Prophecy">predictions</a> would be taking place, and kept a copy of the <a href="/wiki/Atlas_of_Celestial_Anomalies" title="Atlas of Celestial Anomalies">Atlas of Celestial Anomalies</a> at <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard Castle</a> to help him interpret his findings.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> At the end of his life, Grindelwald claimed foreknowledge of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>'s arrival to his prison cell, which might be another instance of Grindelwald's power of foresight. In addition, Grindelwald's prediction of Voldemort never fully mastering the Elder Wand proved correct, and would cause Voldemort's own demise during his final duel with <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Wandless_magic" title="Wandless magic">Wandless</a> and <a href="/wiki/Non-verbal_spell" class="mw-redirect" title="Non-verbal spell">nonverbal magic</a></b>: Grindelwald was extremely skilled in both wandless and nonverbal magic. While posing as Percival Graves, Grindelwald swiftly Summoned <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a>'s wand and suitcase over to him, both with a silent wave of his hand. Grindelwald also wandlessly lifted Newt Scamander from the ground from across the room and then made him, <a href="/wiki/Porpentina_Goldstein" title="Porpentina Goldstein">Tina Goldstein</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Kowalski" title="Jacob Kowalski">Jacob Kowalski</a> simultaneously drop to their knees with their arms locked behind against their backs, all with a silent hand gesture. When he interrogated Newt shortly thereafter, Grindelwald Summoned the protective orb containing an Obscurus by silently gesturing it forth. He later saved the life of Credence Barebone from an oncoming train in the New York City Subway by hurling the young man sideways off the tracks with a wave of his wand-free hand. Grindelwald was even able to send an automobile flying across a street at Tina with a silent wave of his hand. By using only silent hand gestures, Grindelwald generated forceful shock-waves to move and otherwise exert force on people and objects, notably being able to break apart the ground by sending a shock-wave rippling through a street, and later performing this on the train tracks Newt was standing on, to knock him down. Grindelwald later overwhelmed twenty MACUSA Aurors simultaneously without speaking a single incantation. Grindelwald also healed the cuts on Credence's hand by silently running his own over it. While escaping his <a href="/wiki/Incarceration_Carriage" title="Incarceration Carriage">Incarceration Carriage</a>, Grindelwald simultaneously reversed the direction of Aurors' wands, making them point at their own throats, and disintegrated Spielman's wand. He subsequently defeated all of the remaining Aurors (along with <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Incarceration" title="Head of Incarceration">Head of Incarceration</a> Rudolph Spielman) by non-verbally using the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>. After he threw Spielman out of the carriage, he dropped a wand after him and, just before his captor was about to hit the water, made said wand fly into the latter's hand by doing a clasp-like movement with his hand, while both Spielman and the wand were quickly falling through the air. Grindelwald also used wandless magic to accelerate the growth of a baby <a href="/wiki/Phoenix" title="Phoenix">Phoenix</a> to adulthood in an instant, as well as to, both wandlessly and nonverbally, show to others his visions of the future <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a> with his <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_skull-hookah" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s skull-hookah">skull-hookah</a>.</li>
<li><b>Indomitable willpower</b>: Grindelwald had tremendous willpower, as despite the immense task of building a large army by himself after Dumbledore abandoned their plans, Grindelwald remained dedicated, and ended up successfully raising and leading among the most powerful forces of darkness ever fought by the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_World" class="mw-redirect" title="Wizarding World">Wizarding World</a>, very nearly emerging victorious in the <a href="/wiki/Global_wizarding_war" title="Global wizarding war">Global wizarding war</a>. Moreover, Grindelwald was capable of remaining steadfast and focused in his tasks. Even after learning <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a>, who he had previously tossed aside coldly, was the <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">Obscurial</a>, which made recruiting him rather difficult, Grindelwald calmly continued to try to recruit Credence to his side, despite also having to chase after him through New York, and also fend off Newt and <a href="/wiki/Porpentina_Goldstein" title="Porpentina Goldstein">Tina</a> in the process. When Grindelwald learned that Credence was still alive, he quickly resolved to take advantage of the fact that Credence was unaware that the cruel, verbal mistreatment he got from <a href="/wiki/Percival_Graves" title="Percival Graves">Percival Graves</a> had actually come from a disguised Grindelwald. As such, he promptly began seeking Credence out again. Grindelwald also showed no fear when the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> successfully imprisoned him, instead mocking <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a> and <a href="/wiki/Seraphina_Picquery" title="Seraphina Picquery">President Picquery</a> to their faces. His spirit remained unbroken after six months of MACUSA imprisonment, since Grindelwald was so effective at persuading his jailers to join his side, that President Picquery ordered her men to cut out the Dark Wizard's tongue. Indeed, Grindelwald's calm, yet unbreakable resolve greatly contributed to how persuasive his international rallies were. This was demonstrated when Grindelwald did not react violently after one of <a href="/wiki/Theseus_Scamander" title="Theseus Scamander">Theseus Scamander</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> killed one of his followers, so as to show the rally attendees that it was the Aurors, not the cause he advocated, that were truly violent, and were therefore truly to blame for the <a href="/wiki/Global_wizarding_war" title="Global wizarding war">Global wizarding war</a>. Grindelwald was even capable of facing up to his fears, as he duelled Dumbledore when he had no choice. Even after spending fifty-three years in <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard</a> following his defeat, Grindelwald, while the contemplation of his crimes did weigh on him, causing him to supposedly feel remorse for all he had done, he was as confident and fearless as ever when visited by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>. Indeed, despite being defenceless against the greater Dark Wizard, who possessed a far greater capability for evil and destruction along with power and skill superior to Grindelwald‘s own, he was not intimidated and instead sadistically mocked Voldemort's efforts to get information out of him about the Elder Wand, daring the younger and more powerful Dark Wizard to kill him, in a last attempt to find redemption for his crimes.</li>
<li><b>Physical aptitude</b>: Grindelwald, while middle-aged during the <i><a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">For the Greater Good</a></i> revolution, was remarkably fit and agile, as he was easily capable of keeping his footing and holding his balance on top of the roof of the <a href="/wiki/Incarceration_Carriage" title="Incarceration Carriage">Incarceration Carriage</a>, despite its very swift flight through heavy rain, and could nonchalantly drag the full adult <a href="/wiki/Rudolph_Spielman" title="Rudolph Spielman">Rudolph Spielman</a> with a single hand despite Rudolph's struggles. Moreover, despite physical degrading while imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard</a>, Grindelwald still survived in that prison for fifty-three years.</li></ul>

It is unknown how exactly he acquired it nor if he mastered the wand, although the fact that he was able to wield it without handicaps implied he won it by defeating the real Graves in a duel before assuming his identity to infiltrate MACUSA.

<p><a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> first met Grindelwald when he was seventeen. They were introduced by Grindelwald's great aunt, <a href="/wiki/Bathilda_Bagshot" title="Bathilda Bagshot">Bathilda Bagshot</a>. They got along almost instantly, according to Bagshot. They had much in common, including the quest for the <a href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows" title="Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a> and edgy ideals about the structure of a wizard-led society. Eventually, their relationship developed further into one that went beyond mere friendship, one that was romantic, intense and passionate, as well as sexual. The two young lovers made plans to find the Deathly Hallows and lead a <a href="/wiki/Global_wizarding_war" title="Global wizarding war">wizarding revolution</a> with themselves as leaders, but Albus neglected his younger siblings, <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana</a>, as a result. When Aberforth confronted the pair over this, Grindelwald lost his temper and attacked Aberforth. Albus rushed forward to defend his brother, and during the duel Ariana was killed. Grindelwald fled, his relationship with Albus over, although their feelings for one another would not subside.

<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>Over the next few decades, Grindelwald caused considerable havoc on behalf of his revolution but due to a past Blood Pact between them, neither Grindelwald or Dumbledore could directly fight one another, which frustrated Grindelwald as it prevented him from attacking Britain, which was essentially Dumbledore's protectorate and operates on behalf of in his duties outside of Hogwarts. Although at this point, their relationship seemed to be a thing of the past, Grindelwald still acknowledged and respected the extraordinary magical and intellectual capabilities of his former lover, noting Dumbledore far outclassed any of his followers and with his equal intelligence and magical capability, he had the ability to subtly intervene anyway in his revolution, and this respect made Dumbledore the only wizard Grindelwald was wary of. Grindelwald feared Dumbledore as he recognised that Dumbledore would be capable of defeating him. This made Grindelwald seek out Credence Barebone in order to be able to use him as a weapon in case Dumbledore attacked him, although despite his claims of wanting to use Credence to kill Dumbledore, it seemed unlikely as Britain was always noted long after his revolution to be the only place Grindelwald never attacked, which could imply Grindelwald was either willing to tolerate Dumbledore, as at the time, even with the blood pact vial stolen, he didin't have broken it anyway, or he wanted to conquer the rest of the wizarding world first before finally fighting Dumbledore to further increases his chances of victory. It also seemed that Grindelwald retained interest in Dumbledore, as shown by his taking time to question Newt regarding why Dumbledore would be fond of him while disguised as Graves and seeming reluctance to stop questioning him and sentence him and Tina to death after making a mistake, and perhaps may even have unresolved affections for him, as he, repeatedly, showed hatred for Newt being Dumbledore's favourite. Eventually, however, by <a href="/wiki/1945" title="1945">1945</a>, the blood pact between them was abolished. Dumbledore and Grindelwald engaged each other in a legendary <a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">duel</a>, one to be marked as the one of the greatest ever fought between two wizards. However, Dumbledore's greater power and skill ultimately defeated Grindelwald despite his mastery of the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a> during their duel, and Grindelwald was imprisoned in his own prison, <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard</a>.
</p><p>Many years later, in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, Grindelwald refused to give any information to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> about the Elder Wand despite the fact that he was imprisoned, wandless, and face-to-face with the only Dark Wizard ever considered more powerful than himself. This seems to indicate that Grindelwald no longer held the views of those who practised the Dark Arts and had felt remorse for his actions. It was speculated by <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> that Grindelwald had given his life to prevent Voldemort from desecrating Dumbledore's tomb, perhaps indicating that despite all that happened, Grindelwald still retained some care and respect for his old friend and lover. Dumbledore's acknowledgement of Grindelwald's attempt to achieve redemption also indicated he believed Grindelwald was capable of changing out of possible remaining affection for him.

<p><a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth</a> disliked Grindelwald immensely, as he was Albus's friend after <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, and Grindelwald was dismissive of him due to how much he was outshined by Albus. While Aberforth was taking care of Ariana, Albus and Grindelwald were planning to enslave the Muggles. As the two boys were planning to travel around the world, they also planned to take Ariana with them. Aberforth opposed them, telling them that he would be able to take care of Ariana once more. Grindelwald became very angry and used the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Aberforth; Albus then defended his brother and the three boys had a duel, in which Ariana was accidentally killed. Grindelwald escaped and left the country. Aberforth retained bitter memories towards Grindelwald for many years after their fateful encounter, and when he recounted the events that led to his sister's death Harry noted the "positively dangerous" look that came over his face when Grindelwald's name was mentioned.<sup id="cite_ref-DH28_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH28-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Grindelwald was dismissive of the permanently damaged Ariana yet was willing to tolerate her to an extent for his old friend, allowing her to be brought in his and Dumbledore's plans for revolution. However, Ariana tragically died when interfering in Grindelwald's duel with Albus and Aberfoth and Grindelwald fled immediately.

<p>It is unknown if the two had ever met prior; however, by the time Voldemort visited Grindelwald in his <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard</a> prison in 1998, Grindelwald seemed to know all about him, and claimed that he knew that Voldemort would one day visit him to seek out the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>. Despite Grindelwald's past revolution to dominate Muggles and status as one of the most powerful <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizards</a> to have ever lived, considered second only to Voldemort himself, he seemed to have no praise or respect for Grindelwald, and Voldemort likely saw him as an inferior and treated him as merely another person to interrogate in his search for the wand. Grindelwald likewise showed no fear toward the Dark Lord, and laughed, scornfully challenging Voldemort to kill him and using the younger wizard’s chosen feared name as a mockery of his great power, much to the latter's fury. Grindelwald refused to tell Voldemort the Elder Wand's location and taunted him by telling him that he would never be able to master the wand. Furious at his inability to gain information from the former master of the Elder Wand, Voldemort murdered Grindelwald with the killing Curse.  
</p><p>Ultimately, Grindelwald's prediction of Voldemort never fully mastering the Elder Wand would become reality, and would cause Voldemort's own demise during his final duel with <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>.

<p>Grindelwald, while disguised as Percival Graves, met the gifted Magizoologist in New York in 1926. Grindelwald, not finding Newt's unique personality or magical skills impressive, questioned him on why Dumbledore would be fond of him. Newt at one point was outraged and disgusted when Grindelwald implied Newt was serving the Greater Good and coldly told him he was not one of the dark wizard's acolytes, which actually impressed the Dark Wizard, causing him to smirk. He seemed to have been interested in talking more about it but upon having made a slip up of how he considered the Obscurus without a host useless, he ultimately did everything in his power to have Newt take the blame for the <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">Obscurial</a> deaths and nearly had him executed, albeit reluctantly, although it remained unknown what he would have done to Newt had the conversation continued. Grindelwald also revealed to <a href="/wiki/Porpentina_Goldstein" title="Porpentina Goldstein">Tina Goldstein</a> that Newt had been expelled from Hogwarts for nearly killing a student in an incident involving a magical beast. When Newt intervened in Grindelwald's plan to acquire <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a>, Grindelwald dropped all pretence and ferociously attacked Newt, duelling and even torturing him with lightning spells in a rage. Newt managed to capture Grindelwald by use of <a href="/wiki/Swooping_Evil" title="Swooping Evil">Swooping Evil</a> and revealed his true identity to MACUSA, but before being carried off Grindelwald turned to Newt and said mysteriously "Will we die, just a little?", possibly as a message for Dumbledore due to his knowing Newt's closeness to Dumbledore. Grindelwald later encountered Newt in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> and attacked him and his allies, mocking Newt whether Dumbledore would mourn for him. Newt, however, survived the battle and out of hatred towards Grindelwald for having murdered Leta Lestrange, gave Dumbledore the blood pact vial, which would doom Grindelwald many years later. Grindelwald’s actions towards Newt seem to suggest he hated the younger man not only because he had thwarted him once, but also because he is infuriatingly jealous of Dumbledore’s admiration of Newt’s selfless qualities. It appears that Grindelwald, ever the narcissist, wanted to remain the centre of attention and admiration in his former lover’s mind in spite of his Dark deeds, their now opposing views, and Grindelwald’s own stated desire to have Dumbledore killed.

During Newt's interrogation, he sentenced him and Tina as well to death for her participation without hesitation.

A year later, while convincing Queenie to join his ranks, Grindelwald painted Tina in a negative light by telling Queenie that it wasn't the latter's fault for having an <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> as a sister. He then ruthlessly tried to burn her alive with his cursed flames and would have succeeded had Leta not interfered.

<p>Grindelwald had interacted with Queenie in Paris. When she met him, Queenie was clearly frightened due to his reputation as the greatest dark wizard of the age, and drew her wand in his direction nervously. While he resented Tina, Grindelwald did not extend this to Queenie and calmly manipulated her to join his ranks, taking advantage of Queenie's loving, altruistic, and peaceful personality, by promising her that his <i><a href="/wiki/For_the_Greater_Good" title="For the Greater Good">For the Greater Good</a></i> revolution would fight against the future <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, and would bring about an era where others would be free to love whomever they pleased. Thus, during the rally in the <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_Mausoleum" title="Lestrange Mausoleum">Lestrange family Mausoleum</a>, Queenie passed through the loyalty-testing circle of blue fire, officially joining Grindelwald. After escape from <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, Grindelwald took Queenie with him to his Austrian residence of <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard Castle</a>, and asked her advice about how to appeal to <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence</a>'s current feelings, showing he acknowledged Queenie's expertise in handling the emotions of others.

<p>Grindelwald was reassuring and tender with Credence, giving him the affection the boy had craved and been denied all his life; however, this was mainly in order to use him to find the Obscurus and he coldly tossed him aside when he thought he had obtained his goal, believing him to be no more than a <a href="/wiki/Squib" title="Squib">Squib</a>. Considering Credence unteachable in the ways of magic as a result despite promising to teach him previously, Grindelwald told the boy that the death of <a href="/wiki/Mary_Lou_Barebone" title="Mary Lou Barebone">his mother</a> was his reward instead, although at least he did not just kill Credence to cover any traces. When it was revealed soon after that Credence was in fact the Obscurial, Grindelwald was surprised but quickly recovered and reassumed his old treatment of Credence and tried to recruit him to help expose the North American wizarding community, and create a weapon against <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>.
</p><p>He continued trying to appeal to Credence, telling him that he wanted him to be free from hiding and repressing his power, until he vanished after being attacked by many Aurors. This resulted in Grindelwald furiously lashing out at <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">MACUSA</a> for what he truly felt was an act of injustice on a fellow magical individual, going so far as to drop his disguise as a faithful Auror in a passionate speech against the <a href="/wiki/International_Statute_of_Wizarding_Secrecy" title="International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy">International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggles</a>. As such, because of his magical heritage, Grindelwald showed genuine empathy for how badly and unjustly Credence was treated, not only being upset and resentful of how Picquery had coldly ordered Credence to be destroyed just because he threatened to expose wizardkind, but also pitying how Mary Lou nearly destroyed her own adopted son just because he was magical.
</p><p>Upon learning that Credence had survived and was searching for his true heritage, Grindelwald sought the young man out, and gave him the freedom to come to his rally at the <a href="/wiki/Lestrange_Mausoleum" title="Lestrange Mausoleum">Lestrange family Mausoleum</a>, acting as if he was close to Credence just as he did with Graves, although he did it with even more kindness, saying he only wanted what was best for Credence. At that rally, Grindelwald's persuasive speech induced the desperate Credence to finally choose his side in the <a href="/wiki/Global_wizarding_war" title="Global wizarding war">Global wizarding war</a> by passing through the loyalty testing blue fire and joining <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald%27s_acolytes" title="Gellert Grindelwald&#39;s acolytes">Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes</a>. Grindelwald was true to his word this time, finally giving Credence a <a href="/wiki/Wand" title="Wand">wand</a>, and revealing the young man's birth name: Aurelius Dumbledore, while also encouraging Credence by saying together they would change the world, seemingly being successful in having the latter convinced in breaking the Blood Pact and killing Albus Dumbledore.

Due to this, Grindelwald despised her, as he was planning to lead wizardkind to rise above the non-wizarding community, and seemed pleased when she became a victim of Credence's Obscurus, as he told Credence when believing he was just as a Squib, that the death of Mary Lou was his reward. Months later, Grindelwald showed clear resentment when referring to Mary Lou for her near destruction of her own adopted son just because he was magical.

<p>Vinda Rosier was arguably Grindelwald's most trusted and loyal Acolyte, therefore being the Dark Wizard's anonymous lieutenant.

<ul><li><i>Gellert</i> is the Hungarian version of <i>Gerard</i>, which comes from the Germanic <i>ger</i>, "spear", as well as <i>hard</i>, "brave, hardy". Saint Gellert was an Italian-born missionary and martyr who worked in Hungary.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell%C3%A9rt_Hill" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gellért Hill">Gellért Hill</a> is a high hill overlooking the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Danube">Danube</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Budapest">Budapest</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hungary" title="Hungary">Hungary</a>. Gellért Hill was named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Gerard" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Saint Gerard">Saint Gerard</a> who was thrown to death from the hill. The famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Gell%C3%A9rt" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hotel Gellért">Hotel Gellért</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell%C3%A9rt_Baths" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gellért Baths">Gellért Baths</a> can be found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell%C3%A9rt_Square" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Gellért Square">Gellért Square</a> at the foot of the hill. The [[wikipedia:|]] is located within the hill, facing toward Hotel Gellért and the Danube River.</li>
<li><i>Grindel</i> is old German for "bolt," and is also similar to the mythic monster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Grendel">Grendel</a> who was defeated by Beowulf. This forms a parallel with Albus Dumbledore, whose middle name is "Wulfric". <i>Wald</i> is German for "forest".</li>
<li><i>Grindelwald</i> is also the name of a village and known ski resort in the Bernese Alps of <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.</li>
<li>It is of interesting but purely speculative note that the name <i>Gellert</i> is very close to the name <i>Gelert,</i> the name of a legendary dog of cultural, but little historical, significance to Northern Wales. According to local mythology, Gelert was the most faithful companion of Prince Llewelyn, mistaken for the assailant of the prince's infant heir. His "grave" is a site in Beddgelert (literally Gelert's Grave), Gwynedd, as well as the legend is popular in the area.</li>
<li>In German, wald is "forest." Grind is a scab, as in the hardened covering over a scar, could also be grinsen, a grin or big smile. The words grindel or grendel appeared in early versions of several Germanic languages, including English. Grindan in Old English meant "to grind," and further "destroyer," someone who grinds up others. In Middle English, grindel meant "angry." In Old Norse, grindill was taken from "storm," and also meant "to bellow," or produce a loud, frightening yell. In Danish legend, the Grendel was a fearsome, murderous monster of humanoid form. He was later defeated by the Scandinavian hero Beowulf in the medieval story of the same name.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Although fans view Grindelwald to be similar to Adolf Hitler, it is actually Tom Riddle (Voldemort) who parallels Hitler while Grindelwald himself parallels another fascist dictator, Italian prime minister Benito Mussolini.</li>
<li>In a <a href="/wiki/2005" title="2005">2005</a> interview around the same time <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i> was published, Rowling stated that it was not a coincidence that he was defeated in <a href="/wiki/1945" title="1945">1945</a>. hinting at a connection with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and at least the European front of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:World War II">World War II</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Leaky_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Leaky-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> Grindelwald seems to be the wizarding version of Adolf Hitler. As referenced by Rowling, the date of Grindelwald's duel with Dumbledore coincides with the downfall of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers_of_World_War_II" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Axis powers of World War II">Nazi Germany</a>. There are other similarities as well. Grindelwald adopted an ancient symbol as his sigil (the symbol of the Deathly Hallows) just as the Nazis adopted the swastika, an ancient symbol, switching its facing to create the Nazi swastika. Furthermore, the prison <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard</a> shares a similar name to the Franconian city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, where war criminal trials of former Nazis were held. Nurmengard's dual role as prison to both the victims and later the perpetrator may be a reference to Nuremberg's dual significance in World War II, which, aside from being the site of the Nuremberg Trials, was also the site of the proposal and adoption of the Nuremberg Laws, infamous discriminatory laws against Jewish people. Nurmengard also bears a sign that reads "For the Greater Good", which may correspond to the infamous "Arbeit Macht Frei" sign (German for "Work Liberates") which hung above the entrance to Auschwitz. Grindelwald's eventual sole imprisonment in his own prison is possibly a reference to the fate of Rudolf Hess, who from <a href="/wiki/1966" title="1966">1966</a> until his death in <a href="/wiki/1987" title="1987">1987</a> was the sole prisoner of Spandau prison.</li>
<li>In a <a href="/wiki/2005" title="2005">2005</a> interview around the same time <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i> was published, Rowling stated that Grindelwald was dead.<sup id="cite_ref-Leaky_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Leaky-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> However, it was revealed in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i> that he was still alive and imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Nurmengard_Castle" title="Nurmengard Castle">Nurmengard</a>.

<ul><li>Grindelwald was the first known Durmstrang student introduced in canon, although the fact that he attended Durmstrang was only revealed in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>.</li>
<li>Aside from Harry Potter and Beedle the Bard, Grindelwald is the only character who is mentioned by name in a title of the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_World_(franchise)" title="Wizarding World (franchise)">Wizarding World franchise</a>.</li>
<li>Along with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nagini" title="Nagini">Nagini</a>, Grindelwald is one of four characters who appear in both the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)" title="Harry Potter (film series)"><i>Harry Potter</i></a> and <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_(film_series)" title="Fantastic Beasts (film series)">Fantastic Beasts</a></i> film series to date.</li>
<li>J.K. Rowling describes Grindelwald as a sociopath.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Gellert Grindelwald claimed that he knew that Voldemort would come to him. It is unknown whether this was a guess or if he foresaw it due to being a Seer.</li>
<li>When questioned on Grindelwald compared to Voldemort, the Fantastic Beasts cast believed Voldemort was far more evil than Grindelwald, as Zoe Kravitz noted she thought Grindelwald was more complicated than Voldemort while Alison Sudol stated she thought Grindelwald was more evil and Dan Fogler being unsure. When asked who will win in a duel, while Zoe Kravitz said Voldemort, Callum looked unsure and stated "but Harry took him down." and while most of the cast believed Grindelwald would easily win in a fist fight as his body was far more well-built and fit than Voldemort, and Katherine Waterston said she thinks Voldemort would fight dirty and win.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>It was revealed by <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> during a tour in <a href="/wiki/2007" title="2007">2007</a> that <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> was homosexual and harboured romantic feelings for Grindelwald.<sup id="cite_ref-JKR_36-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-JKR-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> Although she did not initially comment on Grindelwald's sexuality, Rowling later stated in a interview with Melissa Anelli in the enhanced edition of Harry a History that she felt, because Grindelwald was a user and a narcissist, he most likely manipulated  Dumbledore's feeling to achieve his own goals. She said that she “[did not] think“ that someone like Grindelwald would reciprocate Dumbledore’s feelings. This left fans wondering about the true nature of their relationship for years.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> Finally, in 2018, on the <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts:_The_Crimes_of_Grindelwald" title="Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald">Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</a></i> digital bonus features, <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J.K.Rowling</a> clarified <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> and <strong class="mw-selflink selflink">Gellert Grindelwald’s</strong> relationship: “Their relationship was incredibly intense. It was passionate and it was a love relationship. But as happens in any relationship.......one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You can't know. You can believe you know. So I'm less interested in the sexual side though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationships.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>In a deleted scene from the Crimes of Grindelwald Dumbledore tells Newt that many years ago Grindelwald had a vision in which an <a href="/wiki/Obscurial" title="Obscurial">obscurial</a> kills the <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">man</a> he fears above all others.</li>
<li>Interestingly of note, Grindelwald is the only character in the entirety of the series to address Tom Riddle by his chosen name, Voldemort, as most people address him as "my Lord" or in rare cases, "Tom", the latter as a form of mockery.
<ul><li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i>, Harry calls him by his name, but only in the film.
