At the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Wing" title="Hospital Wing">Hospital Wing</a>, she was visited by <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a> and Jacob's sibling. If the latter asked what was she heard, she would reveal she heard a wolf's howl and a girl's scream from her worst memory: Scarlett's death. Jacob's sibling connected the attack with the plan "<a href="/wiki/R" title="R">R</a>" has to unleash "it" on Hogwarts.

<p>Penny excitedly introduced Jacob's sibling to her younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Beatrice_Haywood" title="Beatrice Haywood">Beatrice Haywood</a>, who has just started her first year, at the <a href="/wiki/Start-of-Term_Feast" title="Start-of-Term Feast">Start-of-Term Feast</a>. Penny voiced her concern about young Beatrice being eager to join Jacob's sibling on their adventures, and distracted her by asking her to give them the toy <a href="/wiki/Puffskein" title="Puffskein">Puffskein</a> she made for them. The Haywoods then left to tour the <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff_Common_Room" title="Hufflepuff Common Room">Hufflepuff Common Room</a> to let Jacob's sibling catch up with their other friends.
</p><p>The sisters' happiness together was short-lived, however. When Jacob's sibling was meeting with <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">William Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a> to discuss the <a href="/wiki/Cursed_Vaults" title="Cursed Vaults">Cursed Vaults</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Three_Broomsticks_Inn" title="Three Broomsticks Inn">Three Broomsticks Inn</a>, Penny burst in in a panic; Beatrice had gone missing. Penny feared she may have went into the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> because of the stories of curse-breaking she told her. The staff was already searching the castle, so the four of them searched the forest in pairs. Jacob's sibling could choose Penny to go with them to search <a href="/wiki/Red_Cap" title="Red Cap">Red Cap</a>'s hole, and the <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantula</a> lair, where she threatened to burn down the whole lair if the spiders harmed her sister.
</p><p>Fruitless in their search, they returned to the castle; Bill and Jacob's sibling watched in concern as Penny attempted to invent a potion - which even seventh-year Bill found more complex than anything he knew - that would grant her powerful <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a> to locate Beatrice wherever she was. However, to her disappointment, it did not work. Jacob's sibling promised her that they would not give up.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a> arrived saying she found Beatrice and led them to her - trapped in a painting in the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Staircase" title="Grand Staircase">Grand Staircase</a>, leaving Penny devastated. <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Rakepick" title="Patricia Rakepick">Patricia Rakepick</a> noted the <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>, <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Filius Flitwick</a> and herself already tried every spell they knew to no effect, and that Beatrice's perception of reality was becoming increasingly distorted. In her last moments of full coherence, Beatrice asked Jacob's sibling to take care of Penny.
</p><p>Penny spent part of <a href="/wiki/History_of_Magic" title="History of Magic">History of Magic</a> class brewing a potion at the back of the classroom, although the subject was considered so dull half the students decided to watch her and chat instead. She may ask Jacob's sibling to pass a note via paper plane to a fast-asleep <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a>. She revealed that her parents were so worried they considered sending her home, and that they were furious that Hogwarts were not doing more to save Beatrice.
</p><p>Penny's life began to fall apart. <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, who considered her his best student, noted she was failing academically and had became resigned to being consumed by grief. Alarmed, Jacob's sibling resolved to help her stop becoming self-destructive. Even <a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a> reluctantly admitted to being concerned about her.
</p><p>Jacob's sibling found her next to the portrait where Beatrice is trapped. Penny told them that Beatrice was scared, could not hear her and could only see her sometimes, and regretted letting her out of her sight and messing with the <a href="/wiki/Cursed_Vaults" title="Cursed Vaults">Cursed Vaults</a>. Jacob's sibling reaffirmed their commitment to saving her, despite Penny expressing hopelessness. Penny was grateful for their support and asked them to meet her in the forest.
</p><p>They found a <a href="/wiki/Unicorn_horn" title="Unicorn horn">unicorn horn</a> as Penny believed it would be an ingredient in a potion she needed. They then found a pin cushion in the <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a> classroom; Jacob's sibling uses <a href="/wiki/Reparifarge" title="Reparifarge">Reparifarge</a> to transfigure it back to a porcupine so Penny could pluck its quills while they obtained <a href="/wiki/Moonstone" title="Moonstone">Moonstone</a> from <a href="/wiki/Jae_Kim" title="Jae Kim">Jae Kim</a> as a favour, and the latter wondered why they are helping Penny. Despite only knowing him for a short time, if Jacob's sibling had a very close friendship with Penny, they may confess they they fancy Penny and that they had never told anyone. Jae advised them to tell her about their feelings.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Herbology" title="Herbology">Herbology</a> class, when they were preparing to gather <a href="/wiki/Syrup_of_Hellebore" title="Syrup of Hellebore">Syrup of Hellebore</a>, Penny asked Jacob's sibling why they were always so nice to her, prompting them to blurt out that they are attracted to her. Penny was shocked and speechless; she was too occupied with her sister's plight. Jacob's sibling understood and said it could wait until she was safe, and Penny promised they would talk after that. She also thanked them profusely for their help.
</p><p>Penny revealed she planned on brewing a <a href="/wiki/Draught_of_Peace" title="Draught of Peace">Draught of Peace</a> to calm herself down. Jacob's sibling may choose to allow her to drink it, unwilling to see her in so much pain, or stop her, worried it may sicken her if brewed incorrectly. They may also refer to the incident with the <a href="/wiki/Forgetfulness_Potion" title="Forgetfulness Potion">Forgetfulness Potion</a> in their third year.
</p><p>Penny thought the <a href="/wiki/Fat_Friar" title="Fat Friar">Fat Friar</a> might be of help, although he directed them to <a href="/wiki/Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington" title="Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington">Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington</a> instead for their search on <a href="/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" title="Marauder&#39;s Map">Marauder's Map</a>.
</p><p>Penny was present in the meeting called to discuss the vault portrait. However, when the conversation descended into a chaotic argument, the normally sociable Penny was uncharacteristically the only person out of the group of eleven to remain completely silent throughout. She was absent in a later meeting of Jacob's sibling's friends to catch up, where Rowan attacked the others under some kind of control.
</p><p>Penny asked Jacob's sibling to meet her at the Grand Staircase and informed them another student was pulled into a portrait, a Third-Year that they did not know, and that Beatrice could not hear her any more. She stressed the importance of breaking the curse and asked them what to do if she were to find the vault before they did.
</p><p>After more other students are trapped in paintings, Penny may tell Jacob's sibling that Beatrice is getting weaker. If Jacob's sibling used <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a> on Penny, they would find that she was reliving the moment of her finding Beatrice trapped over and over.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When the time came to enter the Cursed Vault, Jacob's sibling must choose either <a href="/wiki/Charles_Weasley" title="Charles Weasley">Charles Weasley</a> or Penny Haywood to join the team. If Charlie was chosen, Merula would complain they should have asked Penny instead. If Penny was chosen, she must be convinced at <a href="/wiki/Hog%27s_Head_Inn" title="Hog&#39;s Head Inn">Hog's Head Inn</a> to join; she then went to see Beatrice one more time before going with the others. Jacob's sibling may express discontent with recruiting their friends who were less prepared for the dangers.
</p><p>If Penny accompanied the others to the vault, she would attempt to use <a href="/wiki/Unlocking_Charm" title="Unlocking Charm">Unlocking Charm</a> on the portrait door, although it did not work. When the <a href="/wiki/Buried_Vault_Hungarian_Horntail" title="Buried Vault Hungarian Horntail">Buried Vault Hungarian Horntail</a> burst out of the portraits, she along with Merula and Ben would be trapped in debris while Bill attempted to free them. After the dragon was defeated and they were freed, Penny tried to push against the door to no avail, before Jacob's sibling opened the door with <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a>.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Patricia_Rakepick" title="Patricia Rakepick">Patricia Rakepick</a> then blasted everyone else present, revealing that she had been to the vault before, working with Jacob and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a>. When Rakepick used the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Merula and turned out too powerful to defeat, Jacob's sibling used Snape's <a href="/wiki/Garrotting_Gas" title="Garrotting Gas">Garrotting Gas</a> against her. Penny was furious that Rakepick had hidden the knowledge of the vaults the whole time. They all attacked Rakepick, finally overwhelming her and forcing her to <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Disapparate</a> away.
</p><p>Inside the final room, after Jacob's sibling freed Jacob, the latter was introduced to Bill and Penny, and Penny commented that they have heard a lot about him. When Jacob also Disapparated to beat Rakepick to the last vault, Penny consoled Jacob's sibling, saying that they at least know he was alright and they would meet again. Penny asked how they were going to return to Hogwarts, leading to the group finding another Portkey back, which Penny was eager to take as she would only be convinced the curse was broken when she could hug Beatrice again. The Portkey transported them to the <a href="/wiki/Great_Hall" title="Great Hall">Great Hall</a>. Upon landing, a severely weakened Merula collapsed, and Penny sped off to get help.
</p><p>Having ran all over the castle to retrieve <a href="/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey" title="Poppy Pomfrey">Poppy Pomfrey</a>, <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, Penny returned to Merula, out of breath. Penny listened as Jacob's sibling told the three about Rakepick's treachery, and helped Merula go to the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Wing" title="Hospital Wing">Hospital Wing</a> at Pomfrey's insistence while Jacob's sibling must go to talk with <a href="/wiki/Rowan_Khanna" title="Rowan Khanna">Rowan Khanna</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ben_Copper" title="Ben Copper">Ben Copper</a>.
</p><p>While Jacob's sibling was upset that their brother left them again, they were glad Penny and Beatrice were reunited. Penny asked them to meet up at the Courtyard. The sisters were very happy to be together again, and Penny said they spent much time outside after Beatrice was trapped for so long and thanked them. If Penny was at the vault, Jacob's sibling also praised her courage. They discussed Beatrice's ordeal, with Penny and Jacob's sibling reassuring her. Penny expressed her pain in being torn apart from her sister, before catching herself and apologising, remembering what happened with Jacob. When Beatrice expressed fear over a professor turning out to be evil and Penny tried to reassure her, Jacob's sibling was reminded of Merula, prompting them to leave to visit her.
</p><p>Penny attended the party at the <a href="/wiki/Three_Broomsticks_Inn" title="Three Broomsticks Inn">Three Broomsticks Inn</a> for Bill's graduation, and appeared concerned when <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a> took Jacob's sibling away with Side-Along <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Apparition</a>, although she, along with everyone else except Rowan and Rosmerta, had already left when Jacob's sibling returned.
</p><p>Penny was with Jacob's sibling when they found a crowd in the courtyard; <a href="/wiki/Emily_Tyler" title="Emily Tyler">Emily Tyler</a> had stolen <a href="/wiki/Ismelda_Murk" title="Ismelda Murk">Ismelda Murk</a>'s diary and reading out loud all about her crush on <a href="/wiki/Barnaby_Lee" title="Barnaby Lee">Barnaby Lee</a> and mocking her. Penny became upset at the scene and asked Jacob's sibling what they should do. Later, she would mention that she told <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Professor McGonagall</a> about Emily's behaviour.
</p><p>Jacob's sibling may ask Penny to help Ismelda confess to Barnaby. Penny gave Ismelda various advice, and finished with telling her to be herself, although she hastily added "minus the death threats" after Ismelda's response.
</p><p>When Ismelda's confession did not go well on the oblivious Barnaby, she stormed off. Penny and Jacob's sibling found Ismelda and <a href="/wiki/Jae_Kim" title="Jae Kim">Jae Kim</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Staircase" title="Grand Staircase">Grand Staircase</a>, and realised she planned to use a <a href="/wiki/Love_potion" title="Love potion">love potion</a> on Barnaby and Penny speculates whether she should brew an antidote.
</p><p>Penny and Jacob's sibling confronted Ismelda and Penny pleaded her not to use it as Jae excused himself. However, she would not stop them if Jacob's sibling encouraged her to use the love potion; Penny would watch in shock as the scheme went wrong and Barnaby became infatuated with Jacob's sibling instead, and lead Barnaby away to get an antidote. If Jacob's sibling convinced Ismelda not to use the love potion, Penny would say she made the right choice, and leave to dispose of the love potion-infused sandwich.
</p><p>In a <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> class, Jae wondered if Penny would tell a professor about what he did. After class, Ismelda talked Jacob's sibling and accepted her rejection fairly evenly; if Penny helped Ismelda, Jacob's sibling would express gratitude for her help.<sup id="cite_ref-crushed_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-crushed-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>

<p>At the <a href="/wiki/Start-of-Term_Feast" title="Start-of-Term Feast">Start-of-Term Feast</a>, Penny wondered where Beatrice was.
</p><p>Penny found Jacob's sibling and Merula blasting dummies after Merula swore revenge on Rakepick, and wondered why they are doing that in the dark. Merula lashed out at Penny for "judging" her and said she hated Penny and everyone. Penny was taken aback, but Jacob's sibling assured Penny that Merula was in a bad mood. Penny wanted to talk about Beatrice; she met with Jacob's sibling at the Three Broomsticks, clearly saddened. While hesitant, with some coaxing, she told Jacob's sibling that Beatrice spent the summer sulking, trying to act older than she was, and becoming distant from her. Beatrice had been avoiding Penny and hanging out with a new crowd. Jacob's sibling promised to talk to Beatrice.
</p><p>They found Beatrice with <a href="/wiki/Ismelda_Murk" title="Ismelda Murk">Ismelda Murk</a> at the courtyard. When Jacob's sibling approached, Beatrice immediately rolled her eyes and said that Penny has got to them. They argue and Jacob's sibling may choose to say they cared because Penny cared about Beatrice. Regardless, Beatrice was not swayed and told them to let her be.
</p><p>Jacob's sibling received a message that "Miss Haywood" needed them, incorrectly assuming it was Penny, but it was actually Beatrice who wanted them to witness the first victim of the statue curse.
</p><p>Beatrice asked Jacob's sibling to meet them at the Artefact room, where she told them to tell Penny to back off, saying she did not want to talk to her. However, Penny found them and confronted Beatrice about skipping the classes she had to retake due to being trapped for much of her first year, leading to a heated argument. Jacob's sibling attempted to excuse themself, but was stopped by both sisters. They continued to bicker with Jacob's sibling trapped between the saddened and worried Penny and the angry and rebellious Beatrice. Despite Jacob's sibling asking them not to, they are forced to take a side. Regardless of their choice, they could not stop the argument from escalating until Beatrice yelled at Penny that she wished she was not her sister and that she would "disappear", before storming out of the room, leaving Penny and Jacob's sibling shocked. Realising that it reminded them of Jacob, Penny apologised and attempted to console them, but they were distracted by a missing skull which they deduced may be stolen by Ben.
</p><p>When Bill Weasley returned to help the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> class, Penny said it was great to see him again, but expressed reservations about Ben's new daredevil attitude. Penny was the first to voice support for his extra lessons, to help protect her sister and friends. During the lesson, she wondered how Bill had been since the last vault.
</p><p>When Jacob's sibling followed a trail to track down Jacob, Penny in the library commented she saw someone looking like him in there.
</p><p>Penny met Jacob's sibling at the courtyard, where she was eager to introduce them to <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>, but she noticed they were upset. Jacob's sibling explained they saw Jacob but he left them again, and his warning that an assassin is after them, to Penny's sympathy and shock. Jacob's sibling changed the subject back; they met Cedric and Penny said he was "cool", talked about among Hufflepuffs, and modest. If Jacob's sibling chose to welcome Cedric, Penny would say she knew they would get along; if they chose to challenge him, they would insult his 'perfect but humble' image as an attention-seeking act, which would start a brief argument with Penny, but in both cases they were interrupted by Sickleworth running by. Regardless of choice, Penny apologetically declined helping with the investigation as she was to introduce Cedric to the <a href="/wiki/Potions_Club" title="Potions Club">Potions Club</a>.
</p><p>On the way of their hunt for Sickleworth, Jacob's sibling and <a href="/wiki/Diego_Caplan" title="Diego Caplan">Diego Caplan</a> came across Beatrice and Ismelda tossing Puffskeins, and Beatrice accused them of spying on her for Penny, although they denied doing so. While searching, Jacob's sibling complained about Penny not helping them and Diego echoed with his disbelief that Penny would hold such a high opinion of Cedric.
</p><p>When Diego left to practice his duelling, Beatrice volunteered to help to prove to Penny that Hogwarts was unsafe; when they had a hard time finding Sickleworth, Beatrice mentioned how hard it was for her to hide from Penny. Depending on whether they sided with Penny or Beatrice in their previous argument, Beatrice would be angry at or thankful for their intervention. They then discussed Jacob and compared their relationships with their older siblings.
</p><p>When Jacob's sibling was meeting with <a href="/wiki/Jae_Kim" title="Jae Kim">Jae Kim</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andre_Egwu" title="Andre Egwu">Andre Egwu</a> to discuss a gift for a special client, Penny could be heard in the background worried that Beatrice was considering a nose ring.
</p><p>When Tonks jokingly suggested to put Rowan on trial for being too depressing in a History of Magic lecture on the <a href="/wiki/Salem_Witch_Trials" title="Salem Witch Trials">Salem Witch Trials</a>, Penny said it was not Rowan's fault it is so sad.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Jacob's sibling met Penny at the Three Broomsticks. Penny told them that Beatrice was still ignoring her, while Beatrice could be seen hanging out with Merula and Ismelda on the other side of the pub. Jacob's sibling told her of the death threat on one of their friends. Contrary to some others reactions, Penny was firm that the threat would not scare her from being their friend. Jacob's sibling had to convince her to brew a love potion for a deal they made in order to obtain an <a href="/wiki/Invisibility_cloak" title="Invisibility cloak">Invisibility cloak</a> for their plan to sneak into the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> to retrieve <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Rakepick" title="Patricia Rakepick">Patricia Rakepick</a>'s dark artefacts before the latter could. Penny was very apprehensive about the potion, and may bring up Ismelda's fiasco with attempting to use a love potion on Barnaby last year; she became even more agitated when Jacob's sibling mentioned sneaking into the Ministry, as she feared they would be thrown into <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for the infraction. After finally being convinced, she requested Jacob's sibling to gather the ingredients.
</p><p>She apparently told <a href="/wiki/Barnaby_Lee" title="Barnaby Lee">Barnaby Lee</a> that Muggle parents put up good grades of their children on fridges, although the latter said his parents were in Azkaban and they did not have a fridge. When Jacob's sibling and <a href="/wiki/Rowan_Khanna" title="Rowan Khanna">Rowan Khanna</a> got reacquainted and reconciled at the <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade_station" title="Hogsmeade station">Hogsmeade station</a>, the latter mentioned that they knew Jacob's sibling would become popular when Penny befriended them.
</p><p>Jacob's sibling went to the <a href="/wiki/Artefact_Room" title="Artefact Room">Artefact Room</a> with the ingredients for the love potion, but was surprised by Penny's uncharacteristically flat, stony attitude and asked her what's wrong. Penny told them that due to their request, she had been thinking about the matter of <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a>; contrary to what she previously thought, she had come to the decision that the best way to show Beatrice that she loved her was to give her space. However, during the conversation, Jacob's sibling let slip about resenting their brother for leaving them again. When <a href="/wiki/Andre_Egwu" title="Andre Egwu">Andre Egwu</a> came in saying <a href="/wiki/Alistair_Fidgen" title="Alistair Fidgen">Alistair Fidgen</a> was impatient, Penny bottled up the love potion quickly for the trade.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Jacob's sibling updated Penny and Charlie on the situation of a dark wizard escaping and likely coming after them. Charlie pointed out all their friends and their siblings may also be in danger. Penny, who was busy being worried about Jacob's sibling, did not think of that and started to reconsider her stance on Beatrice and her safety. When Charlie blamed Jacob's sibling for bringing danger to them, an angry Ben used <i><a href="/wiki/Langlock" title="Langlock">Langlock</a></i> on him. Penny was shocked and concerned; after Jacob's sibling used the <a href="/wiki/General_Counter-Spell" title="General Counter-Spell">General Counter-Spell</a> to stop it, Charlie and Ben started yelling at each other and Penny begged them not to fight. However, Ben refused her attempts at reconciliation and told them to leave while he wanted to prove himself.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>At <a href="/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey" title="Poppy Pomfrey">Poppy Pomfrey</a>'s request, Jacob's sibling asked Penny to help brew some <a href="/wiki/Pepperup_Potion" title="Pepperup Potion">Pepperup Potion</a>. They thought Penny looked anxious and offered to do it themselves. While brewing, Penny revealed that she checked on Beatrice because of the threat of the escaped dark wizard, which led to another argument and their relationship becoming even worse than before. They also talked about Jacob, and Jacob's sibling responded with a more positive attitude, which also cheered Penny up.
</p><p>Snape found the two and told them to go to the Hospital Wing for an emergency. When they rushed in, they found that Pomfrey has been petrified. Cedric was at the scene, but was too shaken to recount his story, until Penny emphasised with him, saying her sister was trapped in a portrait and that Jacob's sibling helped her cope. After his account, Penny said how this curse was the worst of all.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After a DADA tutoring session, Bill asked Jacob's sibling, Ben, Merula, and either Penny or Charlie to stay behind to discuss the Cursed Vaults (depending on who was picked to enter the Buried Vault). If Penny did not visit the Buried Vault, she would still want to stay but relented when Bill said it is best only talked about between those who had been there. If Penny stayed, she would be told along with the others about Bill thinking the last vault is underwater and they should research where exactly it could be, and also stop Ben and Merula fighting.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When Jacob's sibling and Beatrice snuck out to the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lake" title="Great Lake">Great Lake</a>, Beatrice asked them whether they would tell Penny. She would be angry or relieved, but either way, she did not want to talk about Penny further.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When Beatrice and Jacob's sibling met Jae at detention, Jae was surprised at how "Penny's little sister" looked so different. During detention, Beatrice said Penny would never get into detention. After they finished working, Penny came into the kitchens to give Jacob's sibling a message, and was shocked to see Beatrice there. Depending on their previous choice, either Jae let slip what Jacob's sibling and Beatrice were up to, or Jacob's sibling explained themself. Penny became incredibly worried and upset hearing the story, but Beatrice stormed off and Penny told Jacob's sibling to leave because <a href="/wiki/Talbott_Winger" title="Talbott Winger">Talbott Winger</a> needed to see them urgently.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When students and staff gathered to mourn the death of <a href="/wiki/Rowan_Khanna" title="Rowan Khanna">Rowan Khanna</a>, Penny could be seen weeping openly next to Jacob's sibling. If Penny did not go to the Buried Vault, she would say she knew why Rowan was in the forest. After Dumbledore's eulogy, they would meet at the corridor, where Penny may say she could burst into tears any moment. Penny revealed she told what she knew about 'R' and their threat to Rowan, which made the latter resolve to protect Jacob's sibling and thus followed them into the forest, and Penny blamed herself for Rowan's death. However, Jacob's sibling would blame themself or Rakepick.
</p><p>If Jacob's sibling was in Hufflepuff, Penny would be with them with Professor Sprout gave the announcement that the fugitive and the dementors have left and students may leave the castle, and the following discussion. Penny seemed to have a particularly hard time deal with her grief, not helped by Beatrice still refusing to talk to her. When the rest of their friends decided to go to Hogsmeade, Penny wanted to stay back with Beatrice but the latter told her to go. Beatrice said she wanted to help at the Hospital Wing and Penny should be with her friends; Penny was surprised at and appreciative of her empathy and maturity. Beatrice said she did not need Penny and asked Penny to take care of herself, expressed sympathy to Penny over her friend's death, and then burst into sobs; Penny pulled her into a big hug.
</p><p>Penny was at Three Broomsticks when Jacob's sibling got everyone's attention and they began to reminiscence over Rowan. Afterwards, Penny and Charlie caught up with Jacob's sibling alone next to the fireplace, and the latter admitted they did not remember the last time they hung out with Rowan. Jae approached them and reminded them of the time they spent at the Hogsmeade Station, which cheered them up a little.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>

Penny and Charlie already knew some of it and convinced others of its threat. Upon Ben revealing the name of the society, Penny began to cry again, saying that she thought she was done crying; Charlie told her it would only be done when 'R' was dealt with.
</p><p>Beatrice, who was not in the group, was found with Ismelda and Merula talking about the issue. Jacob's sibling may choose to tell Penny of her involvement, or not. Ismelda and Merula were against letting Penny know, but Penny walked in, having learned where Beatrice was from Cedric. Penny said losing Rowan made her realise how easily she could lose someone. She apologised to Beatrice for not understanding her and pleaded her not to push her away this time. Ismelda made a slightly snide comment about Penny being weepy, but Beatrice defended her, and said she wanted Penny to stay.<sup id="cite_ref-hm20_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hm20-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When Jacob's sibling was meeting <a href="/wiki/Chiara_Lobosca" title="Chiara Lobosca">Chiara Lobosca</a> in the Great Hall, Penny said it was nice to talk to Beatrice again, and Jae mentioned Penny was teaching Circle of Khanna's concealment and disguises team <a href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup>

</p><p>When Jacob's sibling and Alanza Alves arrived at a meeting between Penny, Merula, Ismelda and Beatrice, Penny welcomed her warmly. Penny was not comfortable about the others stealing ingredients, but conceded it was the only way. She was surprised that Alanza recognised they were making <a href="/wiki/Felix_Felicis" title="Felix Felicis">Felix Felicis</a>.

</p><p>When Jacob and Jacob's sibling found Beatrice floating unconscious in the lake, they brought her to the Hospital Wing. When Penny and Jacob's sibling visited her, she said she went to the lake because she had been having nightmares, saw a giant tentacle and dived in to possible find out more about the last cursed vault. When Jacob's sibling and Penny were alone, the former suggested asking Snape to figure out Beatrice's nightmares.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>

</p><p>Penny met Jacob's sibling in the library and told them Snape prevented her from gathering the powdered <a href="/wiki/Horn_of_Bicorn" title="Horn of Bicorn">Horn of Bicorn</a>, although Jacob's sibling was confident they could get around him.

<p>Penny had blue eyes, pale white skin and long blonde hair with two thick braids over her shoulders, and a braid on her left side that formed a ponytail, giving her a half up. She often styled her hair differently for special occasions, including a crown braid for <a href="/wiki/Celestial_Ball" title="Celestial Ball">Celestial Ball</a>, a French braid for her potential first date with <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a>, and a side French braid for Valentine's Day and the Romance Festival.
</p><p>Penny adorned different garments to special occasions (including her white and yellow <a href="/wiki/Dress_robes" title="Dress robes">dress robes</a> at the Celestial Ball). True to her house's colours, those outfits always featured yellow prominently, which was also her favourite colour<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>. However, she otherwise almost never wore anything other than her plain robes, as the standard <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_uniform" title="Hogwarts uniform">Hogwarts uniform</a> that is not modified or accessorised in any way, even outside class.

Similarly, although she would eventually gift Jacob's sibling with a potion belt when they became very close friends, she was never seen wearing it, unlike Chiara's necklace or <a href="/wiki/Rowan_Khanna" title="Rowan Khanna">Rowan Khanna</a>'s glasses.
</p><p>Penny was often considered attractive, whether by a friend like <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> or the usually mean-spirited <a href="/wiki/Ismelda_Murk" title="Ismelda Murk">Ismelda Murk</a>. <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a> claimed that Penny was pretty enough to repel a <a href="/wiki/Red_Cap" title="Red Cap">Red Cap</a> without the need of a <a href="/wiki/Beautification_Potion" title="Beautification Potion">Beautification Potion</a>.

<p>A classic Hufflepuff, Penny was dedicated, loyal, and hardworking; however, she did exhibit darker aspects of her personality. She reacted very poorly to <a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a> stealing her credit, was sometimes prone to reckless potion-taking in stress or grief, and she could be stubborn and resistant to change. Her strong attachment to those close to her could cause her to be overprotective, excessively dedicated to the detriment of herself, or becoming an emotional wreck from loss. In her earlier years, she found it exciting that Jacob's sibling would invite her to dangerous adventures while others only invite her to parties; the tragic murders of two of her close friends and her sister's imprisonment and subsequent falling out affected her deeply. She suffered from chronic nightmares, and dipped into depression and occasional fearfulness (possibly exhibiting symptoms of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>).

<ul><li>By year 5, the player is able to express romantic interest for Penny (regardless of Jacob's sibling's gender), causing Penny to promise to the player that they will discuss their feelings for each other after Beatrice is rescued. While a large variety of characters are possible dates in side quests, this occurred prior to their releases and is so far the only such moment in the main story, making Penny the closest thing to a canonical love interest for Jacob's sibling.</li>
<li>Penny is one of the four characters (along with <a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andre_Egwu" title="Andre Egwu">Andre Egwu</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Barnaby_Lee" title="Barnaby Lee">Barnaby Lee</a>) available as romance options for all four dating side quests: Celestial Ball (requires level 9 friendship with Penny), First Date, Valentine's Day and Festival Fun.</li></ul></li>
<li>Penny's Celestial Ball appearance varied prior to release, with concept art showing her dress to be entirely yellow, and leaked model showing her wearing what appears to be a golden laurel wreath.</li>
<li>In her fifth year, Snape's criticism of her handling of Beatrice's situation echoed his remarks towards then-fifth year <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> on the principles of <a href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a>, considering them weak for being openly emotional and wallowing in their grief. However, given that Snape's loyalties ultimately lay with the protagonists, this could be seen as having been for their own good; after hearing that, Harry did understand the importance of and eventually succeeded in blocking his connection with Voldemort, and Jacob's sibling was spurred to support Penny and prevent her from a path of self destruction.</li>
<li>Jacob's sibling may choose Penny to accompany them in their search for the <a href="/wiki/Vault_of_Ice" title="Vault of Ice">Vault of Ice</a>; if she is chosen. she will use a <a href="/wiki/Strengthening_Solution" title="Strengthening Solution">Strengthening Solution</a> to allow herself to tear open a frozen door.</li>
