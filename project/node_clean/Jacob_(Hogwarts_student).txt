In particular, their <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_mother" title="Jacob&#39;s mother">mother</a> was strict about the use of magic outside of school, refusing both of her children to ride a <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a> before they began attending school.

<p>At age eleven, Jacob visited <a href="/wiki/Ollivander%27s" class="mw-redirect" title="Ollivander&#39;s">Ollivander's</a> in <a href="/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a>, and caused <a href="/wiki/Garrick_Ollivander" title="Garrick Ollivander">Mr Olivander</a>'s favourite inkpot to explode when trying out <a href="/wiki/Wand" title="Wand">wands</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> He attended <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a> for an unknown period of time and was sorted into an unknown <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses" title="Hogwarts Houses">house</a>.
</p><p>However, at some point during his later school career, Jacob embarked on a foolhardy quest to uncover the secrets of the fabled <a href="/wiki/Cursed_Vaults" title="Cursed Vaults">Cursed Vaults</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> presumably in order to get his hands on the gold, prophecies and various other powerful magical artefacts, myth would have it, had been sealed within them.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Not alone in this endeavour, however, assisting him in this search were two of his friends, <a href="/wiki/Duncan_Ashe" title="Duncan Ashe">Duncan Ashe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Olivia_Green" title="Olivia Green">Olivia Green</a>, two fellow students in <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw House</a>, respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-:4_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:4-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> This was not the first time that a student was known to have looked for the vaults, the last one being a former <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> student, <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Rakepick" title="Patricia Rakepick">Patricia Rakepick</a>, who likewise was a firm believer in the existence of the vaults and tried to warn the school staff about them, but whose claims were dismissed due to a lack of evidence.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> In the case of the pupil in question, however, it would seem like there were some merits to the tales that were told. Admittedly intrigued by their soon-to-be notorious ringleader, who was, after all, judged to be thoughtful and considerate by some,<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> while simultaneously being one of the most talented and rebellious students of his time at school.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> As such, the Headmaster <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> took a personal interest in young Jacob, and even decided to help nurture his gift upon discovering that Jacob was a born <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimens</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>As time passed, however, Dumbledore could not help but notice how Jacob became increasingly obsessive in his search for the vaults and, he sensed, changed because of it. He become ever more impulsive and reckless, leading to the violation of "all sorts of school rules" and endangerment of both himself and his peers in the process. Eventually, Dumbledore grew concerned that this fixation might even drive him to madness. Unable to overlook their pursuit for the vaults for these reasons, Dumbledore was known to have reprimanded both Jacob and Mr Ashe for their recklessness on at least one occasion.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> This did not dissuade the adventurous youth, however, and their hunt for the vaults ended in tragedy when the latter was killed while attempting to brew a particularly potent <a href="/wiki/Erumpent_Potion" title="Erumpent Potion">Erumpent Potion</a> in an effort to get past one of the obstacles standing between them and one of the Cursed Vaults.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> No longer able to turn a blind eye to the magnitude of what had transpired, Dumbledore notified the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> about Duncan's untimely demise, which eventually sent two <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> to bring Jacob in for questioning about the incident. Having found him at the <a href="/wiki/Three_Broomsticks_Inn" title="Three Broomsticks Inn">Three Broomsticks Inn</a> in <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> village, they apprehended him and took him away.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup> During the interrogation, Jacob admitted to having pressured his friend into making the potion as part of their bid to open the vaults.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_13-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> In light of Jacob's confession, Professor Dumbledore had no other choice but to <a href="/wiki/Discipline_at_Hogwarts#Expulsion" title="Discipline at Hogwarts">expel</a> him from the school.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Duncan Ashe was not the only casualty, unfortunately. Every time one of the vaults was disturbed, another curse was triggered and unleashed upon the school. <a href="/wiki/Cursed_ice" title="Cursed ice">Cursed ice</a> began to appear and spread throughout the castle, turning whole rooms into crystalline prisons, threatening to encase the whole school,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> and severely injuring several of the students. A <a href="/wiki/Sleepwalking_curse" title="Sleepwalking curse">Sleepwalking curse</a> was also triggered, placing students in a deep slumber and causing them to mindlessly wander off into the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> in the direction of <a href="/wiki/Forest_Vault" title="Forest Vault">one of the vaults</a>, where those whom the staff failed to stop were, due to their condition and inability to defend themselves, ravaged and some even outright devoured by the dangerous creatures within. Others, <a href="/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey" title="Poppy Pomfrey">Madam Pomfrey</a> observed, simply never woke up again.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Although Dumbledore and the rest of the staff ultimately managed to contain the curses and got the situation under control, the faculty nevertheless denied any knowledge that the vaults actually existed, quite possibly hoping to dissuade other students from pursuing the vaults as well, by quieting down the attention around them after Jacob's removal from the school was so prominently covered in the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">Daily Prophet</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>At some point after all of this took place, however, Jacob became aware of the existence of a secretive clique known simply by the initial '<a href="/wiki/R" title="R">R</a>', which had become active in the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a> some time prior. A dissenting, clandestine group of dangerous <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizards</a> about which very little was known, yet whose ruthless pursuit of 'enlightenment and <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">immortality</a>'<sup id="cite_ref-:3_13-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> had given rise to various furtive activities and operations around the world<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> and ultimately saw them turn their attention to Hogwarts. Their involvement in the disturbance of the Cursed Vaults had been a covert one, though, and unbeknownst to Dumbledore and the rest of the staff at the time, coercion had been a driving force behind Jacob's obsession with the vaults.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> Having initially joined forces with the cabal in question hoping that they could help him find the vaults, the villainous organisation had instead eventually turned the tables on him, and forced him to assist them in their own search instead by threatening to make those Jacob cared about '<a href="/wiki/Death" title="Death">disappear</a>' if he failed to cooperate, while simultaneously hanging a promise of future membership over his head if he did well.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_13-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> It had in fact been 'R' that pressured Duncan Ashe into making the potion that cost him his life, and Jacob had simply taken the blame out of fear that they would make good on their threats had he exposed them.<sup id="cite_ref-:3_13-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>At some point before he disappeared, Jacob went to the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> and ran into a centaur named <a href="/wiki/Torvus" title="Torvus">Torvus</a>. He told Torvus of the Cursed Vaults and convinced him to help. Jacob wanted a Centaur's arrow for his search of the Cursed Vaults, but when Torvus refused, Jacob used magic to steal it from the camp.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Shortly after he was kicked out of school, Jacob ran away from home and went mysteriously missing.

<p>During the end of the <a href="/wiki/1988%E2%80%931989_school_year" title="1988–1989 school year">1988–1989 school year</a>, when Jacob's sibling and their friends along with Rakepick entered the portrait vault and defeated the <a href="/wiki/Hungarian_Horntail" title="Hungarian Horntail">Hungarian Horntail</a> inside, it is revealed that Rakepick entered this vault with Jacob and Peter Pettigrew (who ran out in fear of the dragon) and that Jacob opened a door with his Legilimency as it was the 'key' to the treasure inside. Rakepick had unwillingly left Jacob in there and used his sibling, who had his same talent for Legilimency, to open the door and use their friends to help along the way. Rakepick showed her true colours when she decided to kill them all and used the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Merula. Jacob's sibling and their friends initially tried to <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">disarm</a> her, but a powerful <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">Shield Charm</a> she had cast over herself blocked their spells. Jacob's sibling however managed to subdue her with <a href="/wiki/Garrotting_Gas" title="Garrotting Gas">Garrotting Gas</a>, causing her to choke, allowing them all to knock her out, although she managed to <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">disapparate</a> away afterwards.
</p><p>Jacob was found by his sibling trapped inside a portrait, and, upon realising it was him, they excitedly professed their pleasure at finally seeing him after all these years, and rushed over to him, lovingly embracing him in joy and relief, with the two siblings sharing a heartfelt and emotional reunion. After breaking apart, Jacob then sarcastically asked his sibling why it had taken them so long to find him, to which they responded incredulously, although Jacob, addressing his younger sibling as "Pip", acknowledged that he was merely joking and knew he hadn't been easy to find. Upon expressing their disapproval for their childhood nickname, "Pip", Jacob cheerfully assured them that that it was a quality nickname and remarked in surprise how they hadn't changed a bit, and they responded likewise, prompting Jacob to point out that he had been trapped inside a portrait for years after all. Jacob then compassionately noted that his sibling must have endured a lot to find him, to which they also noted that he'd been through a lot too, upon which Jacob acknowledged that he had. He then proceeded to thank them deeply for their refusal to give up on him after all these years, upon which they asserted that they could have never given up on him, as he was their older brother. His sibling's friends then entered and were equally shocked and surprised to see him. After telling him that Rakepick brought them into the vault, he became angry and informed them of Rakepick being "evil", and that he had to go and stop her before she could find the 'treasure' and give it to "<a href="/wiki/R" title="R">R</a>". His sibling tried to make him stay, as they had only just been reunited, and that together they could stop her, but Jacob told them that, because he was the one who caused all the mess, he should be the one to stop it. He told his sibling that they will meet again and told them to stay safe before leaving via <a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Apparition</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-y5ch30_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y5ch30-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>

<p>While known among students and staff at the school as a troublemaker (whose apparent disregard for school rules and the safety of those who dwelt at the school proved outright dangerous), there were indicators that suggested that there was more to him than the circulating rumours would suggest. For example, while a rebellious young man, he was still a clever and talented student, being one of <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Professor Flitwick</a>'s most gifted students<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> prior to his expulsion, and is remembered fondly by the school's <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Herbology" title="Head of Herbology">Head of Herbology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pomona_Sprout" title="Pomona Sprout">Professor Sprout</a>, for being a kind and caring individual.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> This was later reinforced when Jacob's own <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">younger sibling</a> reacted with righteous anger over being confronted with even the possibility of Jacob ever having had anything to do with <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> when <a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a> confronted them with the rumour claiming he worked for him.
</p><p>From what Jacob had shown after he was freed, he showed guilt and remorse for the mess he had started by tampering with the Cursed Vaults and lack of fear in pursuing Rakepick despite the warnings of his sibling, proving he was indeed a good-hearted man with a strong capability for remorse and desire to make up for his mistakes along with great courage. Jacob also returned the great concern of his sibling by refusing to bring them with him to pursue Rakepick.
