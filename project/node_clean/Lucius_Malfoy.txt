As well as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoy family</a>. Lucius was educated at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, where he was made a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">prefect</a> in <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin House</a>. As an adult, Lucius was an aristocratic wizard and patriarch of the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoy family</a>, believing strongly in notions of blood purity and the <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood_supremacy" title="Pure-blood supremacy">superiority of pure-blood</a> wizards. He joined the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, who shared his views on blood purity, and participated in the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>.
</p><p>After <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>'s first defeat, Lucius managed to avoid imprisonment by claiming that he had been acting under the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>. He and his family remained members of the social elite, though Lucius continued to demonstrate his prejudice. He attempted to sabotage <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>'s career by slipping Arthur's daughter an old school diary of Tom Riddle's, opening the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> in <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, and in <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>, he participated in the humiliation of a <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> family after the <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_World_Cup" title="Quidditch World Cup">Quidditch World Cup</a>.
</p><p>When Voldemort <a href="/wiki/Return_of_Lord_Voldemort" title="Return of Lord Voldemort">returned</a>, Lucius once again served him as a Death Eater, leading the efforts to obtain <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">the prophecy</a> Voldemort sought. In the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">battle</a> that ensued, the prophecy was destroyed, and Lucius and his comrades were imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>. Although Voldemort broke them out of prison in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, he was displeased with Lucius for his failures and treated the Malfoys with much disdain and abuse. Lucius and his family finally rebelled against Voldemort's tyranny and defected before the end of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, with them all surviving the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>.

</p><p>The scion of an old wizarding family noted for its wealth and influence, Lucius was ultimately a model student that lead by example and became a voice of authority among his peers; and effectively managed to uphold his family's noble name, be a credit to Slytherin House and master the art of keeping up appearances all in one fell swoop when he was named a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">Prefect</a> in his <a href="/wiki/Fifth_year" title="Fifth year">fifth year</a>, and by being invited to join the out-of-hours dining and social club hosted by their always talent-scouting <a href="/wiki/Potions_Master" title="Potions Master">Potions Master</a>, <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a>, known as the '<a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a>'.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> In <a href="/wiki/1971" title="1971">1971</a>.

</p><p>Lucius's arrival at school coincided with a recent <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">increase in dark magical activity</a> throughout <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a>; while few knew what lay behind the mounting attacks and sightings, the truth was finally revealed in the form of a <a href="/wiki/Dark_wizard" class="mw-redirect" title="Dark wizard">Dark wizard</a> of immense power. But whereas <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> were swiftly becoming a source of widespread fear by a most of his own <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">kind</a>, Lucius, on the other hand, found himself rather agreeing with their views regarding the <a href="/wiki/Magic_is_Might" title="Magic is Might">treatment</a> that the non-magical community deserved.

<p>Lucius graduated from Hogwarts around the year of <a href="/wiki/1972" title="1972">1972</a>, and being independently wealthy and with no need to work for a living, continued to inhabit the family estate; free at last to enjoy full-time the creature comforts that their ancestral home had provided him throughout his privileged upbringing. At some point, he also became romantically involved with <a href="/wiki/Narcissa_Malfoy" title="Narcissa Malfoy">Narcissa Black</a>, a fellow wealthy pure-blood and <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> student back at Hogwarts with whom he had a lot in common; not least of all their shared anti-Muggle sentiments, fondness for the lavish and privileged lifestyle that their rich family vaults afforded them. In due time, the uppish couple entered what was seen as a very respectable, pure-blood <a href="/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marriage</a>, and took up residence at <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a>. In doing so, Lucius also officially assumed both the patriarchy of the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoy family</a>, ownership of their <a href="/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf">House-elf</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a>, and gained the possession of a prized <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy%27s_walking_stick" title="Lucius Malfoy&#39;s walking stick">family heirloom</a> that had been passed down for many generations. This, he began to carrying around with him, both as a status symbol and as a replacement for his original wand. Heir apparent to a long line of wily beneficiaries of political patronage in the magical community, Lucius also wasted little time in carrying on the family tradition of frequenting the headquarters of the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, where he successfully used his family name and fortune to curry favour with a number of high-ranking Ministry officials, and became a very well-connected man.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>That was not to say, however, that this was all he aspired to do with his life: Because even though his former teachers had done an adequate job of sheltering their charges from the storm that had only continued to brew in the world beyond <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Castle" title="Hogwarts Castle">Hogwarts Castle</a> in the years that he had resided there, and despite the <a href="/wiki/Curse-to-kill" title="Curse-to-kill">strong-arm tactics</a> that the <a href="/wiki/Auror_Office" title="Auror Office">Auror Office</a> had been <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">authorised</a> to employ in the effort to suppress it, it was nevertheless the case that the Dark Lord's campaign of violence had just grown ever fiercer.

</p><p>Despite his high standing in the ranks of the Dark Forces, his loyalty were primarily towards the <i>cause</i> rather than to the man representing it, as shown by how he still associated with those of his former comrades who, like him, avoided <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>, many of which became close friends of the family.

The most prominent evidence for his initial disinterest in revisiting his past and lack of faithfulness to the Dark Lord himself was how Lucius disregarded rumours of Lord Voldemort's survival as wishful thinking, and instead took interest in potentially allying himself with the very person who had brought about their former Master's downfall.

<p>Harry proved Ginny's innocence and pointed an accusing finger at the true culprit — Lucius. Lucius challenged the boy to prove his claims, but Dumbledore who had returned to Hogwarts at the request of the governors, stated that would be impossible with the diary beyond repair. However, he warned Lucius not to sell any more of Voldemort's school things, as Arthur Weasley would likely trace them back to him. Subsequently (and adding insult to injury) Harry in gratitude to Dobby managed to trick Lucius into setting Dobby free. He accomplished this by wrapping the diary in his own sock before handing it back to Lucius. Dobby then caught the sock after Lucius carelessly tossed it aside; therefore, he was no longer forced into the servitude of the Malfoy family.<sup id="cite_ref-COS18_47-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS18-47">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Lucius had a pale, pointed face, with pale blond hair and cold grey eyes. He often carried a <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy%27s_walking_stick" title="Lucius Malfoy&#39;s walking stick">walking stick</a> with a snake head that contained <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy%27s_wand" title="Lucius Malfoy&#39;s wand">his wand</a>. After spending a year in the wizarding prison of Azkaban, possibly suffering the horrors of the Dementors' presence, his looks suffered greatly because of it, his skin taking on a yellowish and waxy look, and his eyes sunken and shadowed. His voice was also quite hoarse. Later that year, after having been a victim of the Dark Lord's wrath upon Harry Potter's escape from the Manor, Lucius' looks took a turn for the worse, as he seemed ragged, and he carried traces of his punishment, meaning he might have looked beaten and bruised. It is likely that his looks might have improved upon the fall of his former Master once he returned to everyday life. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm; this had faded to a mere scar upon Voldemort's death.
</p><p>His son <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco</a> resembled him strongly.<sup id="cite_ref-GOFskinhair_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOFskinhair-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> It was stated that his grandson, <a href="/wiki/Scorpius_Malfoy" title="Scorpius Malfoy">Scorpius Malfoy</a>, resembled Draco, meaning that Lucius and his grandson also had a resemblance.

<p>Due to being the embodiment of wealth and influence in the wizarding world, Lucius Malfoy took great pride in his aristocratic stature by viewing himself as being biologically superior to <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggles</a> and <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-borns</a>, although his views on <a href="/wiki/Half-blood" title="Half-blood">half-bloods</a> were likely more tempered as many a half-blood appears on the Malfoy family tree.<sup id="cite_ref-pureblood_61-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pureblood-61">&#91;61&#93;</a></sup> He was also a very shrewd, opportunistic social climber who was good at controlling others, but behind his veneer of respectability, he treated people cruelly.

<p>Lucius could be intelligent and manipulative when he needed to be, allowing him to gain respect and the good will of high-ranking individuals through his fortune and family name. He even had influence with Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge. Lucius' constant donations to important establishments were actually nothing more than bribing Fudge for classified information, delaying laws, and receiving undeserved rewards and recognitions.
</p><p>While putting much effort into maintaining an appearance of respectability, Lucius's slick demeanour did little to hide his self-serving nature. He had no qualms about appealing to whichever side would be more beneficial to his social advancement. He was never unconditionally loyal because he didn't want to be put in a negative light with people on either end. During the Quidditch World Cup, he anonymously participated in the lowly torturing of Muggles but fled when the Dark Mark was cast in the sky. In fact, rather than going to find Lord Voldemort when he lost all his powers in the first place, he instead pretended to have seen the error of his ways and tried to ingratiate himself to the Ministry of Magic. He claimed that he was always alert for Voldemort's return but when Voldemort pointed out that he had fled from the Dark Mark, Lucius was instantly silenced. Despite this, he did attempt to go through with Voldemort's plan of using his old school diary to open the Chamber of Secrets, not realising that the diary contained a piece of his master's soul (although Lucius was more focused on ridding himself of an incriminating piece of dark magic when the Ministry was conducting searches).
</p><p>However, in spite of his ruthless and prejudiced nature, one of Lucius's more redeeming traits was that he was very loving and devoted towards his family, especially caring greatly for his wife and son. He and Narcissa were indulgent and protective of their only child, though Lucius also demonstrated that he had expectations for his son, in one instance berating him for being beaten academically by Hermione Granger. In the end, along with Narcissa, he demonstrated that his family was more important to him than serving Voldemort, especially after Voldemort lost both the respect and trust he once had from the Malfoys. Lucius' love for Draco and Narcissa also allowed him to overcome his more self-serving side as he charged straight into the thick of battle during the siege on Hogwarts in an attempt to find Draco, eventually locating him after Voldemort was finally defeated and the battle came to an end.
</p><p>Despite his love for his son, Lucius became disappointed in Draco for losing his value in <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood_supremacy" title="Pure-blood supremacy">pure-blood supremacy</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>, and for marrying <a href="/wiki/Astoria_Malfoy" title="Astoria Malfoy">Astoria Greengrass</a>, who underwent similar changes to Draco's. Father and son had an argument for Draco's willingness to let the Malfoy bloodline end with him to preserve Astoria's <a href="/wiki/Blood_malediction" title="Blood malediction">frail body</a>, showing that Lucius still maintained his belief in pure-blood supremacy over the well-being of a human being, and that the mistreatment he received from the Second Wizarding War did little to change his opportunistic and bigoted personality. He even employed <a href="/wiki/Theodore_Nott" title="Theodore Nott">Theodore Nott</a> to create a "true" <a href="/wiki/Time-Turner" title="Time-Turner">Time-Turner</a>, a dangerous device that would give him the potential to go back in time to avert Voldemort's demise. Yet due to the fact that he never used it, it shows Lucius remained inclined to the dark side, as was seen by his creating and keeping such a dangerous and illegal device, and passing it on to his son. However, it can be also inferred that Lucius didn't have any intention at all to bring back his former master, as Draco later reflected that Lucius seemed to like a world without Voldemort.

When <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ronald Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> were captured by <a href="/wiki/Snatchers" title="Snatchers">Snatchers</a> and brought to <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a>, for example, Lucius was able to quickly identify the cause of the former's appearance as the result of a <a href="/wiki/Stinging_Jinx" title="Stinging Jinx">Stinging Jinx</a>, even though his comrades present could not. The extent of his power and skill as a Dark Wizard was shown by how he was able to successfully perform the <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curses</a>, which required tremendous skill and genuine malice, as shown by his proficiency at the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>, successfully placing <a href="/wiki/Sturgis_Podmore" title="Sturgis Podmore">Sturgis Podmore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Broderick_Bode" title="Broderick Bode">Broderick Bode</a> under control, which allowed him to carry out his master's orders.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP26_29-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP26-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> He was also known to enjoy the torturing of Muggles with dark magic, along with his fellow Death Eaters.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF33_30-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF33-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup> Furthermore, Lucius owned an impressive collection of numerous dark magical artefacts and <a href="/wiki/Curse" title="Curse">cursed</a> objects in his home, many of which he likely purchased from <a href="/wiki/Borgin_and_Burkes" title="Borgin and Burkes">Borgin and Burkes</a>, being a frequent customer there, and was also able to understand them thoroughly and interact with them.<sup id="cite_ref-LEGOY1_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LEGOY1-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Indeed, even Voldemort trusted him to take care of his <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_Diary" class="mw-redirect" title="Tom Riddle&#39;s Diary">diary</a>, one of his <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, speaking for his confidence in Lucius' ability to manage dark objects, although his neglect and misuse of this item ultimately led to its destruction, much to his master's fury. He also used <a href="/wiki/Dark_charm" title="Dark charm">Dark charms</a> when he lead fellow <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> in torturing Muggles at the <a href="/wiki/Reappearance_of_the_Dark_Mark" title="Reappearance of the Dark Mark">riot at the World Cup</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF9_55-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF9-55">&#91;55&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">Duelling</a></b>: Lucius was a highly skilled duellist, though not as aggressive as some of his fellow <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, instead favouring a more elegant, refined technique when he engaged an adversary, and generally demonstrating great form in his duelling style. A veteran of the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>, Lucius fought the enemies of the Dark Lord during his former master's first rise to power and, as his most senior lieutenant at the time, led fractions of the dark forces into battle.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">&#91;63&#93;</a></sup> Having held his own against trained <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> and members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> alike during the historical conflict, Lucius survived the war and were ultimately able to evade capture until after Voldemort's fall from power. An impressive feat, given the fact that he and the rest of his allies were up against the likes of <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>, who filled half the cells in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> with those Lucius fought alongside with and how the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Department" title="Head of Department">Head</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement">Department of Magical Law Enforcement</a> of the day, <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">Bartemius Crouch</a>, authorised the <a href="/wiki/Auror_Office" title="Auror Office">Auror Office</a> to <a href="/wiki/Curse-to-kill" title="Curse-to-kill">kill rather than capture</a>, and Lucius consequently proved capable of emerging from combat situations that were no-holds-barred as well as fending off people who simply sought to arrest or capture him. In spite of not having seen action for about thirteen years, Lucius had maintained his skill at martial magic; successfully fought the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a> officials that tried to apprehend him and his comrades during the <a href="/wiki/Reappearance_of_the_Dark_Mark" title="Reappearance of the Dark Mark">Riot at the Quidditch World Cup</a>, although he, like them, fled when the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> was sent skywards by <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">one of their fellows</a>. He was also notably the only Death Eater (apart from <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>) who had enough confidence in his own abilities to stand up to <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Lucius showed proficient reflexes in deflecting Harry Potter's <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">Stunning Spell</a> with relative ease, contrasting at least two of his comrades who broke their ranks to avoid the ones from his friends. Shortly afterwards, he blocked another such spell from <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a>, one of the <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> that had arrived to rescue the students that he and the other dark wizards present were targeting. In the same battle, he also stood his ground against <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, until the arrival of <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> saw him rounded up with his peers.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Potion" title="Potion">Potions</a></b>: Lucius was skilled in the brewing of potions.<sup id="cite_ref-PM_64-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-64">&#91;64&#93;</a></sup> While in school at Hogwarts, Lucius was noted by <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> to be proficient in <a href="/wiki/Potions_(class)" title="Potions (class)">potions</a> and his talent in potion-making even earned him a place among Slughorn's elite <a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_57-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-57">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup> Furthermore, Lucius owned a rather impressive repertoire of various <a href="/wiki/Poison" title="Poison">poisons</a>, showing he likely had knowledge of such substances.<sup id="cite_ref-COS4_15-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-COS4-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Nonverbal_spell" title="Nonverbal spell">Nonverbal magic</a></b>: Lucius was capable of casting offensive <a href="/wiki/Spell" title="Spell">spells</a> while duelling non-verbally, showing a great amount of skill in this field, given the high level of difficulty required in the casting of non-verbal spells, a further testament to his skills as a powerful wizard.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTPF_65-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTPF-65">&#91;65&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Apparition" title="Apparition">Apparition</a></b>: Like most accomplished adult wizards, Lucius was capable of apparating at will. After the Return of the Dark Lord, he Apparated to the Little Hangleton Graveyard to witness the rebirth of his master, along with many other Death Eaters.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF33_30-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF33-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b>Intellectual giftedness</b>: Lucius was a rather astute and wily man, having been a model student during his time as a student and even made a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">Prefect</a> at his fifth year, a position bestowed upon academic high-achievers that had proven themselves capable, both in class and out. As an adult, his political acumen was such that it enabled him to effectively influence matters of state; being persuasive enough in conversation to win the respect of high-ranking bureaucrats such as <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, and the goodwill of various politicians, whom he was able to convince to make changes that favoured Lucius' own agenda over that of other important people. Indeed, throughout the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a> and during the early stages of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second</a>, Lucius was able to effectively balance his roles as both among the most prominent and politically influential individuals at the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>, <i>and</i> the <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Dark Lord</a>'s second-in-command, while also possessing the foresight to prepare a contingency plan on the off-chance that he fell under suspicion of being involved with the Dark Lord by ensuring that he was owed favours by people in high places and could call in to collect them when necessary. After the war, Lucius retained his influence at the Ministry, even becoming a close advisor of the <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a> of the time, <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>.</li>
<li><b>Acting skills</b>: Lucius was a capable actor, having been able to successfully pretend to be on the side of the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> during the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a> while he was actually the <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Dark Lord</a>'s second-in-command, and, even after being captured, managed to convince most of the Ministry that he had been an unwilling pawn and helped the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> against his will. He was also able to successfully pretend that he had no idea at all who was behind the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> attacks while it was actually he who caused it and even when confronted by Dumbledore over this fact, Lucius was able to keep his emotion in check to avoid a confrontation with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> he most certainly knew he would not win. In the beginning of <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>, Lucius was once again able to act as apparent ally to the Ministry while once more serving the Dark Lord, carrying out several acts of covert coercion in an attempt to steal the <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">Prophecy of the Chosen One</a> without being noticed and was only exposed upon his capture in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>.</li>
<li><b>Leadership skills</b>: Lucius was a talented leader even in his younger years, as shown by how he was able to successfully keep his fellow <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherins</a> in check as a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">Prefect</a>. Throughout the majority of the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a> and in the beginning of <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">the second</a>, Lucius's leadership skills made him the <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Dark Lord</a>'s second-in-command. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Lucius displayed his leadership by remaining calm and focused on the mission even when faced with the unexpected situation when <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">his friends</a> made a run for it and split up to confuse them, which he swiftly handled by quickly pairing up the Death Eaters under his command so that they would be pursuing all the teenagers at the same time, leading to the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> rather quick capture of them all, and then leading them against the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, where they even got the upper hand until the arrival of Dumbledore; which led to the swift defeat of him and his allies. In addition to being unaffected by the mockeries of his cause and insults to the Dark Lord, he showed that if the objective was sufficiently important, he would not hesitate in leaving fallen comrades behind, focusing instead on seeing Lord Voldemort's orders through to the very end.</li></ul>

Lucius welcomed him into <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin House</a> when Severus was sorted there and Lucius was a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">prefect</a>, and as part of a <a href="/wiki/Gang_of_Slytherins" title="Gang of Slytherins">group</a> of future <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-DH33_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH33-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> It is also possible that Lucius protected him from bullies, such as <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, as the latter seemed to despise him.

<p>Lucius was one of Lord Voldemort's most trusted and high-ranking <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>, serving him in both the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding Wars</a>. Voldemort gave his <a href="/wiki/T._M._Riddle%27s_Diary" title="T. M. Riddle&#39;s Diary">diary</a> <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcrux</a> to Lucius to retain. Upon his rebirth in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, Voldemort questioned Lucius' loyalty, since he had never tried to find the Dark Lord after his fall in <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF_56-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF-56">&#91;56&#93;</a></sup> Voldemort accepted Lucius' explanations and exultations of devotion, and entrusted Lucius with the task of obtaining <a href="/wiki/Prophecy" title="Prophecy">a prophecy</a> concerning him and <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>. Later however, Lucius selfishly throwing away the diary Horcrux, his failure in retrieving the Prophecy, and subsequent imprisonment in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> made him and his family lose any favour in Voldemort's eyes, and the Dark Lord may gave Lucius' son a nearly impossible task to punish Lucius.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_57-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-57">&#91;57&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Although he <a href="/wiki/Azkaban_escapes#1997" title="Azkaban escapes">broke Lucius out of Azkaban</a> in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a>, along with many other Death Eaters, Voldemort treated him with disdain, taking over his home and <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy%27s_wand" title="Lucius Malfoy&#39;s wand">his wand</a>, and mocking the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoys</a> for their relation to a <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">werewolf</a> through <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Narcissa's niece</a>. Lucius was desperate to regain his master's favour, but the opportunity for that came with the capture of Harry Potter in the spring of <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a> and, unfortunately for him, ended in disaster; Harry and his friends <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_at_Malfoy_Manor" title="Skirmish at Malfoy Manor">escaped</a>, and the Malfoys were severely punished. By the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Lucius had abandoned his loyalty to Voldemort in order to protect his family, and was pardoned for his crimes due to his last-minute defection.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_58-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-58">&#91;58&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Draco mentioned many years later that Lucius never wanted to use the "true" <a href="/wiki/Time-Turner" title="Time-Turner">Time-Turner</a> to save Voldemort, as he probably preferred a world without him, suggesting that even Lucius despised the Dark Lord in the end, particularly due to the ill treatment Voldemort had given to the Malfoy family at their later half of their Death Eater services.

<p>Lucius Malfoy had a strong dislike of Albus Dumbledore. This is due to two reasons – Dumbledore believed in Muggle rights which contradicted Malfoy's pure blood supremacist beliefs. In addition, Lucius was a Death Eater, so he believed that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> was a much more powerful wizard than Dumbledore. Lucius always believed that Dumbledore becoming <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">Headmaster</a> was the worst thing that happened to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. Dumbledore was Headmaster at least part of Lucius` schooltime as Lucius was in his sixth or seventh year when the Marauders started at Hogwarts and then Dumbledore was already Headmaster.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, Lucius Malfoy was indirectly responsible for the second opening of the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>. This was an attempt to discredit <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> but Lucius also wanted to include Dumbledore by using the excuse of blaming him for doing nothing to stop the Chamber's opening. Lucius abused his position as a <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Board_of_Governors" title="Hogwarts Board of Governors">Hogwarts Governor</a> and threatened the other Governors to vote for Dumbledore's <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Suspension" title="Order of Suspension">suspension</a> after several attacks on Hogwarts students. However, when <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a> was taken into the Chamber to lure <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, the other Governors decided to face Malfoy and Dumbledore was reinstated. Lucius was furious that Dumbledore dared to return to Hogwarts to help Harry successfully save Ginny, but Dumbledore was aware that Lucius had threatened the other Governors. Consequently, Lucius was sacked as a Hogwarts Governor.
</p><p>In the following years, Lucius continued to dislike Dumbledore and cause trouble for him. When Voldemort was resurrected in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, Lucius returned to his service. As the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a> was refusing to believe Dumbledore about Voldemort's return, they started a smear campaign to discredit him. Lucius contributed to this smear campaign by describing Dumbledore as "eccentric" for his past choice of teachers including the <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Half-giant" title="Half-giant">half-giant</a> <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> and ex-<a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>. Later that year, Lucius participated in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a> and fought against the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>. However, he was arrested and sent to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>.
</p><p>Dumbledore believed that Lucius would feel "safe" in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> because Voldemort was furious at Lucius' failure in the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a>, and offered to protect Lucius along with Narcissa when Draco threatened to murder the headmaster. It is unknown how Lucius reacted when he learned of Dumbledore's death.

<p>Lucius was the father of Draco Malfoy, Harry's school bully. During their first years at Hogwarts, Lucius discouraged their rivalry, feeling it wouldn't reflect well on them to be on poor terms with such a famous person. When Lucius first met Harry in <a href="/wiki/Flourish_and_Blotts" title="Flourish and Blotts">Flourish and Blotts</a> in <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, he pretended to be polite to him.
</p><p>After Harry succeeded in killing the <a href="/wiki/Basilisk" title="Basilisk">basilisk</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, he confronted Lucius about his suspicions on how Ginny obtained the diary at the beginning of the year and then tricked him into freeing his own servant <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a>. Lucius was furious and from that point on, treated him with cool contempt.
</p><p>Lucius was a little bit more tactful around Harry than other Death Eaters (such as Bellatrix Lestrange) depending on the circumstances. However, Lucius did not openly declare himself against him until after Lord Voldemort took control of the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a>.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, the Malfoy family switched sides, meaning they were forgiven for their crimes. Draco, while he did not necessarily become "friends" with Harry, ultimately made peace with him.

<p>Cornelius Fudge was easily and strongly swayed by money and power. As a result, he favoured people like Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy influenced and likely bribed Cornelius Fudge many times during the latter's tenure as <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a>, in return receiving favours such as delays in laws and given classified information. In the summer of <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>, Fudge invited Malfoy to occupy the top box with him at the <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_World_Cup" title="Quidditch World Cup">Quidditch World Cup</a> final, thanks to his "generous" donations to <a href="/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries" title="St Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries">St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, Lucius returned to Voldemort, but Fudge denied Voldemort's rebirth and insisted that Malfoy had switched sides, and the wealthy Malfoy continued to work with the Ministry. They met after <a href="/wiki/Disciplinary_hearing_of_Harry_Potter" title="Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter">Harry Potter's disciplinary hearing</a> and went upstairs to Fudge's office, where Harry suspected Lucius gave gold to Fudge. Malfoy's frequent visits to Fudge also may have given him opportunity to put Ministry workers (such as <a href="/wiki/Broderick_Bode" title="Broderick Bode">Broderick Bode</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sturgis_Podmore" title="Sturgis Podmore">Sturgis Podmore</a>) under the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a> to attempt to steal <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">a prophecy</a> concerning Harry and Voldemort.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP26_29-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP26-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Fudge was forced to believe that Voldemort had indeed returned, and all the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> who took part on the battle (with the exception of <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>) were sentenced to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>, among them being Lucius. After being imprisoned, Lucius lost his job and influence at the Ministry; Fudge, having been blind to Lucius' true intentions until it was too late, also lost his career and popularity as well.

<p>Rubeus Hagrid was not on good terms with the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoy family</a>. He was disgusted with their pure blood supremacy, their bullying of <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-borns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Blood_traitor" title="Blood traitor">blood traitors</a>, their allegiance to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> and their disrespect to <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, whom Hagrid was fiercely loyal to. In turn, the Malfoys disliked Hagrid, referring to him as an "oaf".
</p><p>In particular, Hagrid disliked Lucius. In <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, Hagrid had to separate <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> and Lucius Malfoy from fighting in <a href="/wiki/Flourish_and_Blotts" title="Flourish and Blotts">Flourish and Blotts</a>. During the <a href="/wiki/1992%E2%80%931993_school_year" title="1992–1993 school year">1992–1993 school year</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> was opened. Lucius was indirectly responsible for the Chamber's opening. However, Hagrid was blamed because he had been framed by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> for the Chamber's first opening fifty years before. As a result, Hagrid was arrested as a precautionary measure by <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>. Lucius was present at Hagrid's arrest, although Hagrid reacted angrily to his presence and ordered him to get out of his house. Lucius mocked Hagrid by wondering how he called his small hut a "house". Lucius was only present at Hagrid's arrest because he had to inform <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> that he and the other governors had voted on his suspension. Hagrid saw through Lucius and shouted at him accusing him of threatening the other governors. Lucius' response was to mock Hagrid's temper and advising him not to shout at Azkaban guards like that. This instance proved that Hagrid did not trust Lucius. Lucius described Dumbledore's decision to employ Hagrid as a teacher as "eccentric".
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a>, Lucius' son, Draco, was injured by Hagrid's <a href="/wiki/Hippogriff" title="Hippogriff">Hippogriff</a> <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a>. Lucius was furious and complained to the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>. At Buckbeak's trial, Lucius was the witness for the prosecution. Hagrid desperately tried to defend Buckbeak but he lost due to Lucius' influence at the Ministry. Buckbeak was sentenced to death but was saved by Harry and Hermione, which possibly led Lucius to feel that the Hippogriff had made him and Draco look like fools.

<p>As a high ranking Death Eater, Lucius was occasionally given leadership over his fellows by Voldemort. When given commands, the other Death Eaters usually follow them without question or signs of resentment. Once Lucius and his family lost favour with Voldemort the other Death Eaters largely lost any respect they had towards Lucius, even loudly jeering at him when Voldemort mentioned their relation by marriage to <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> (through Lucius's niece <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a>).
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> worked alongside Lucius in keeping prisoners in the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a>. They also stood next to each other in the Death Eater circle following <a href="/wiki/Voldemort%27s_return" class="mw-redirect" title="Voldemort&#39;s return">Voldemort's rebirth</a>. Lucius and Peter's Hogwarts years would've overlapped. The relationship between the two is unknown beyond this.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">Barty Crouch Jnr</a> was a highly loyal Death Eater who had a strong dislike towards Lucius for never attempting to search for Voldemort after he disappeared. While disguised as <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>, Barty enjoyed intimidating Lucius's son.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Corban_Yaxley" title="Corban Yaxley">Corban Yaxley</a> seemed familiar with Lucius and his wealthy and extravagant lifestyle, though he expressed this in a snide manner.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a> was a friend and comrade of Lucius's during the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>. Lucius considered sending his son to <a href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang</a> due to Karkaroff's headmastership and the fact that Durmstrang doesn't allow <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">muggle-born</a> wizards and witches to attend.
</p><p>Lucius appeared to be friendly with <a href="/wiki/Crabbe" title="Crabbe">Crabbe</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nott" title="Nott">Nott</a>, as their sons were familiar with each other prior to arriving at Hogwarts. Nott visited the Malfoy Manor on at least one occasion to discuss unknown things with Lucius. Despite this, Lucius didn't hesitate to leave an injured Nott behind during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, knowing that Voldemort would be much angrier at losing the prophecy.
</p><p>Lucius shared at least some of his Hogwarts years with <a href="/wiki/Avery_(disambiguation)" title="Avery (disambiguation)">Avery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mulciber_(disambiguation)" title="Mulciber (disambiguation)">Mulciber</a>, <a href="/wiki/Evan_Rosier" title="Evan Rosier">Evan Rosier</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wilkes" title="Wilkes">Wilkes</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rodolphus_Lestrange" title="Rodolphus Lestrange">Rodolphus Lestrange</a>. He and Rodolphus were brother-in-laws through their marriages with Naricissa and Bellatrix respectively. Lucius also chose Mulciber as his partner during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>.
</p><p>Lucius was disdainful towards werewolf <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Fenrir Greyback</a> when he brought Harry Potter and his friends to the Malfoy Manor. Greyback was likewise resentful of the Malfoy's cold reception and argued with Lucius over who would receive credit for capturing Harry.

Lucius is a name that derives from Latin meaning "bright" or "intelligent" and is related to the name Lucifer, the first name of Satan, which may reference Lucius Malfoy being bright but evil, or just evil.</li>

<ul><li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)" title="Harry Potter (film series)">films</a>, Malfoy is played by <a href="/wiki/Jason_Isaacs" title="Jason Isaacs">Jason Isaacs</a>. To prepare for <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, and to get a sense of how nasty Lucius should be, Isaacs went back and watched <a href="/wiki/Tom_Felton" title="Tom Felton">Tom Felton</a>'s performance in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (film)">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Brett_Underwood" title="Brett Underwood">Brett Underwood</a> appears as young Lucius Malfoy in a <a href="/wiki/Slug_Club" title="Slug Club">Slug Club</a> photograph in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">&#91;67&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, Lucius pushed Harry's hair back over his head to view his scar, which does not happen in the novel.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, Lucius, during his encounter with Arthur Weasley, curtly says to the latter "See you at work", implying that Lucius himself may actually work in the Ministry and thus act as Arthur's coworker. However, this does not seem to be the case in the books, as Draco mentions in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i> that "<i>he's always popping in and out of the Ministry</i>", thereby implying he does not actually work there.
<ul><li>However, the line in the film could also imply that Lucius has visited the Ministry enough times that he and Arthur caught glimpses of each other.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, Lucius accidentally smashes the <a href="/wiki/Prophecy" title="Prophecy">prophecy</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a>, rather than <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>.</li>
<li>Despite not having an appearance in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i> as an adult, Jason Isaacs cameos in a photograph in the <a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">Daily Prophet</a>, and Tony Coburn plays him in a Slug Club photo.</li>
<li>In the novels, Lucius is not stated to have long hair. However, Jason Issacs requested long hair so that people could tell the difference between Lucius and Draco.</li>
<li>It is interesting to note that like his <a href="/wiki/Narcissa_Malfoy" title="Narcissa Malfoy">wife</a>, Lucius Malfoy (perhaps subtly) tried to stop Voldemort from killing Harry. In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i>, Lucius prompted Voldemort to tell the Death Eaters his backstory on how he returned to power <i>after </i>Voldemort stated that Harry was his guest of honour, which could have been the moment where Voldemort initially intended to duel and kill Harry. This, along with the courtesy and care towards Harry in the Department of Mysteries in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">next book</a> could establish that Lucius, as a father, does not like the thought of witnessing, let alone bring about, the murder of someone Draco's age, despite him being a sworn enemy.
<ul><li>Lucius scolded Draco for badmouthing Harry, and reminds him that it was not prudent for him for doing so since the wizarding community regarded Harry as the hero who has vanquished Voldemort.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, when Bellatrix Lestrange attempted to summon Voldemort after the capture of Harry Potter, Lucius tried to stop her and argued that Harry has been summoned in his house, so it was him who should summon Voldemort instead.</li></ul></li>
<li>Also, in the films, Lucius' wand is concealed within a <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy%27s_walking_stick" title="Lucius Malfoy&#39;s walking stick">snake-handelled walking stick</a> that he almost always carries with him. The walking stick may have magical abilities of its own, as Lucius is seen wielding it during a duel in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a> until Harry <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Disarms</a> him of it, to which Sirius Black comments "nice one".</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, after Harry caused him to inadvertently set Dobby free, Lucius Malfoy was about to cast a curse at Harry, but was stopped by <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a>. In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">film adaptation</a>, it sounded as though he was about to cast the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>, because it sounded as though he said, "<i>Avada-"</i>, the entire curse was not heard because he was cut off by Dobby. The attempted use of this curse was the result of an improvisation on Isaacs' part, as the script did not specify which curse he was supposed to use, so he used the first spell that came to his mind.
<ul><li>It is worth noting that the Killing Curse's incantation (<i>Avada Kedavra</i>) had not yet been introduced in the <i>Chamber of Secrets</i> novel. However, the film version was released after the publication of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i> (where the incantation was first introduced), which may be the reason why Isaacs could utter the spell.</li>
<li>Similarly, his dialogue to Harry where he sardonically states that they should hope that Harry Potter is still around to save the day, and Harry's response, was an improvisation by Jason Isaacs and Daniel Radcliffe, respectively, and was not in the original script. It was ad-libbed because Jason Isaacs felt it was completely out-of-character for Lucius Malfoy to simply let Dumbledore have the last word.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">&#91;68&#93;</a></sup></li></ul></li>
<li>In the two last films, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Part 1</a> and <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Part 2</a> of <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Deathly Hallows</a>, Lucius appears to be unshaved, having been put under pressure and stress by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, not to mention being in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for a year or so, where he would have been living in poor state. As a result, he appears thinner and has bags under his eyes.
<ul><li>In addition, Lucius did have a replacement wand in the 7th film, but was dispatched by Harry before he could use it.</li></ul></li>
<li>Lucius Malfoy is ranked Number 12 on the <i>Forbes</i> Fictional 15 list of the richest people in the world.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">&#91;69&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>A variety of Elder Futhark runes are depicted on Lucius's Azkaban placard. The easily identified ones are: Othila, which means "estate, heritage, possession" and corresponds to the Latin letter "o"; Ansuz (albeit rotated slightly), meaning "one of the Æsir (gods)" and corresponds to the Latin letter "a"; Uruz, meaning "wild ox" or "water"; and Mannaz, meaning "man".<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">&#91;70&#93;</a></sup> It is unknown if these serve any purpose (other than for identification, like the numbers and letters), though they may be a reference to different parts of his character. For example, Othila, which could represent his abundance of material possessions &amp; wealth, as well as his emphasis on blood purity ("heritage").</li>
<li>According to Lucius's actor, Jason Isaacs, in the Maximum Movie Mode of Deathly Hallows Part 2, he believed after the battle, Lucius felt isolated from not only from everyone but his family as well.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_5-7" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7</a></i>, Lucius was not able to perform a <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>. Instead, he was able to release a <a href="/wiki/Peacock" title="Peacock">peacock</a> from his inventory. (It's strange because he was able to kill in <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_1-4" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</a></i>.) This is because of the game's design, where the Killing Curse at <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> and the inventory takes the same slot. It is likely that Lucius was "disarmed" from this ability because there were a lot of playable Death Eaters in the game who could perform a Killing Curse.</li>
<li>The filmmakers had planned for Lucius to appear at the execution of <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i> and be outraged when Buckbeak escaped; however, Jason Issacs was unavailable for filming at the time.</li>
<li>Recently, New Zealand biologist Tom Saunders named a new species of wasp after Lucius (<i>Lusius malfoyi</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">&#91;71&#93;</a></sup>
<ul><li>According to Saunders, <i>"People see wasps as villains, as the 'bad guys.' But the truth is that the vast majority of wasp species are either neutral or beneficial, from a human standpoint. Just as Lucius Malfoy is pardoned after separating from Voldemort's allies, I'm asking people to pardon wasps in order to restore their reputation as interesting, important creatures."</i></li></ul></li></ul>
