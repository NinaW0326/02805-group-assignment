Pettigrew was then the new Secret Keeper for <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily Potter</a> after they went into hiding during the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a> with their infant son <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry</a>, keeping their whereabouts in <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a> a secret. However, Pettigrew was secretly a traitor to the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>. He informed <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> of the Potters' location, resulting in the murders of James and Lily and Voldemort's first defeat when the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a> rebounded from Harry. Sirius Black was later believed to have murdered Pettigrew and twelve bystanding <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggles</a> in front of more than fifty eyewitnesses, when really Pettigrew had killed them himself and went into his <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a> form to flee the scene, leaving behind his severed index finger. Caught at the scene of the crime, Black was thus blamed for the betrayal of the Potters (not knowing that Pettigrew had really been the betrayer) and imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for it without a trial. He escaped twelve years later using what was believed to be a trick Voldemort taught him that made Black and his insanity unaffected by the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a>' depressing aura, when really Black had maintained his sanity due to the knowledge of his innocence since incarceration (a non-happy thought that the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> could not take) and went into his <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a> form to slip through his cell door while the Dementors were bringing in his food, swimming across the <a href="/wiki/North_Sea" title="North Sea">North Sea</a> after seeing a picture of Pettigrew still in his animal disguise of "Scabbers", the pet rat of Harry's best friend at Hogwarts <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, on a copy of the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">Daily Prophet</a></i> given to him by then-Minister for Magic <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-POA_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
