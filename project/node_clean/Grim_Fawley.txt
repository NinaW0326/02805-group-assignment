<p>Some time later, Grim was horrified to learn that his wife was counted among a group of five people who gone mysteriously missing in London, along with Riya Patel, Timothy Hale, Kit Gerrard, and Genevieve Bladt - a case that would be referred to as “<a href="/wiki/London_Five" title="London Five">The London Five</a>”.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup> Soon after, <a href="/wiki/Gareth_Greengrass" title="Gareth Greengrass">Gareth Greengrass</a>, a high-ranking official in the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Law_Enforcement" title="Department of Magical Law Enforcement">Department of Magical Law Enforcement</a>, assured Grim that he would “<i>do everything in</i> [his] <i>power</i>" and "<i>save no expense</i>" to find his wife. Considering one of the missing individuals were one of his own subordinates, Harry Potter, was in charge of the investigation. Despite their best efforts, however, the Aurors met a dead end in the London Five investigation,<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup> and thus, the council on which Gareth Greengrass and his colleagues presided over the investigation decided to close the case, leaving the families of the missing distraught. Worse still, part of the reason given for the decision was that the costs of the investigation exceeded the amount that the <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> could afford to spend.
</p><p>Soon thereafter, Grim sent a memo to Greengrass, pleading with him to convince the council to re-open the investigation. To make matters worse, not only had Greengrass deemed it to dismiss it as a bad job, he also implied that he was convinced that Penelope was most likely dead, throwing Grim further into a state of despair. Although Greengrass advised him to take time off work "to grieve and look after his children", having gone so far as to even admit that he had already gone over Grim's head and proposed it to Grim’s superiors behind his back, Mr Fawely refused to take the alleged demise of his beloved Nel on face value and resolved to take matters into his own hands<sup id="cite_ref-:0_39-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-39">&#91;39&#93;</a></sup>. Not long afterwards, he turned to Harry Potter instead, imploring him to '<i>bend the rules</i>',<sup id="cite_ref-:1_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> and continue the search off the records, for Penelope's sake. Soon thereafter, he tried to retrieve his wife's file in order to learn exactly what she had been doing at the time of her disappearance, only to be denied access to it due to the confidentiality of much of its information. This lead him to write an angry message to Mr Potter, insisting that he had a right to access to it, accusing him of showing blatant disregard for his own subordinates and tried to make him change his mind by claiming that he was actively "<i>barring a grieving husband from the closure he deserves"</i>, implying he was pretending to have accepted Greengrass's conclusion as a way of appealing to Harry's emotion to try and convince him, once more, to bend the rules<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup>.
</p><p>At some point later, he stole investigation files regarding the investigation into the disappearance of the London Five, where he discovered that the cited reason given for closing the case, namely the strain of the budget, did not correlate with the actual costs of the investigation, prompting him to issue a complaint to the Ministry's <a href="/wiki/Accounting_Department" title="Accounting Department">Accounting Department</a> and demand an explanation for the inaccuracy in their financial records. Around the same time, Mr Fawley received a letter from a witch by the name of <a href="/wiki/Amorette_Deneuve" title="Amorette Deneuve">Amorette Deneuve</a>, in which she expressed the belief that <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">Love</a> was "<i>the greatest and most dangerous magic in the world</i>", describing it something that "<i>imbues itself into our very bones, our very souls.</i>" This lead Grim Fawely to believe that the power of love might just be the key to find his wife. At a later date, during the investigation into the <a href="/wiki/Calamity" title="Calamity">Calamity</a>, of which Grim was eventually strongly suspected of having caused<sup id="cite_ref-:1_40-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-42">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup> and whose whereabouts became unknown to the Ministry around the same time, it was revealed by the log documenting the time of her entry and exit of the <a href="/wiki/Love_Chamber" title="Love Chamber">Love Chamber</a> that Grim had been coming and going at odd times.
