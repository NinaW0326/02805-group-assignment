<p>Morfin's violent behaviour eventually led to the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> pressing charges against him; in particular for causing <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle Snr</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Unidentified_hive-conjuring_spell" class="mw-redirect" title="Unidentified hive-conjuring spell">erupt with hives</a>. <a href="/wiki/Bob_Ogden" title="Bob Ogden">Bob Ogden</a>, head of the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Law_Enforcement_Patrol" title="Magical Law Enforcement Patrol">Magical Law Enforcement Patrol</a>, was sent to summon Morfin to a hearing. Morfin greeted the wizard with his wand in one hand and a knife in the other, hissing in Parseltongue that he was not welcome. Ogden failed to understand until Marvolo appeared and restrained his son. Taking the discussion inside, Ogden explained that Morfin was summoned to a hearing on the <a href="/wiki/14_September" title="14 September">14th of September</a>, but trailed off upon hearing Tom Riddle Snr and his companion <a href="/wiki/Cecilia" title="Cecilia">Cecilia</a> pass by, criticising the deplorable state of the Gaunt shack. Morfin almost rose from his chair with the presumed intention to attack Riddle again, but was restrained by his father.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP10_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP10-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Morfin then told his father in Parseltongue that his sister was infatuated with Riddle, causing Marvolo to start to strangle Merope, ignorant of the fact that a law enforcement officer was in his very house. Ogden used a <a href="/wiki/Revulsion_Jinx" title="Revulsion Jinx">Revulsion Jinx</a> to separate them and Morfin reacted by firing spells at the Ministry official, including a <a href="/wiki/Pus-squirting_hex" class="mw-redirect" title="Pus-squirting hex">hex that caused yellow pus to flow from Ogden's nose</a>. Ogden fled, then returned to the Gaunt residence with several wizards, who successfully restrained both Morfin and Marvolo, placing both under arrest. The Gaunt men were sent to the <a href="/wiki/Wizengamot" title="Wizengamot">Wizengamot</a> to stand trial, whereupon Marvolo was found guilty of abusive behaviour to his daughter and obstruction of justice. Morfin was found guilty of using a hive spell on a Muggle, resisting arrest, assaulting a Magical Law Enforcmeent Officer, as well as all the earlier crimes that were outstanding. In mid-to-late <a href="/wiki/1925" title="1925">1925</a>, Morfin was sentenced to three years in Azkaban and his father Marvolo received a six-month sentence.<sup id="cite_ref-sentencingdate_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sentencingdate-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>While they were incarcerated, <a href="/wiki/Merope_Riddle" title="Merope Riddle">Merope</a> married Tom Riddle, probably by using either the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a> on him. She died soon after giving birth to a son, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP10_1-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP10-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Marvolo returned from prison to an empty house and died before his son was released from Azkaban. When Morfin finally returned, he found his father dead, and learned that his sister has left the shack only to be abandoned in London by Tom Riddle. He, therefore, became the last heir to the Gaunt family and inherited the <a href="/wiki/Gaunt_Shack" title="Gaunt Shack">shack</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_Ring" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s Ring">family signet ring</a>, their last heirloom.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP17_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP17-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Over the years, Morfin lived in a much more deplorable state than ever, as Merope was no longer there to clean the house. Morfin let his hair grow to extreme lengths, seldom combing or styling it. He also rarely (if ever) cleaned his house, thus leaving the Gaunt residence in a state of extreme filth and squalor, with thick layers of dust and grime covering the place, and all the pots and utensils rusted through. Morfin's house was known for being poorly kept, filled with mould, clutter, and stale, half-eaten food which Morfin would take a long time (if ever) to dispose of. Despite the squalor of the Gaunt shack, Morfin had been more self-sufficient than his father. He had managed to care for himself (albeit rather haphazardly), and presumably found a source of income to earn a living, as there was no record of Morfin being in serious delinquency with <a href="/wiki/Gringott" title="Gringott">Gringotts</a> or other wizarding financial institutions.

<p>Morfin's teenage nephew came to Little Hangleton to learn about his family in the summer of <a href="/wiki/1943" title="1943">1943</a>, and was far from impressed when he saw Morfin's living conditions. He met Morfin, who thought that this stranger looked "mighty like that Muggle", referring to the elder <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle</a>. He told him an incomplete story of what transpired between the man and Merope, which infuriated Riddle Jnr to the point of seeking revenge. After stunning Morfin, Tom went to Riddle's home and murdered his father, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Riddle" title="Thomas Riddle">grandfather</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Riddle" title="Mary Riddle">grandmother</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>, using Morfin's wand.

</p><p>When the Ministry of Magic investigated the crime, Morfin freely bragged and admitted to it and was sentenced to life imprisonment in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>. They checked Morfin's wand to see <a href="/wiki/Reverse_Spell" title="Reverse Spell">what its last spell was</a>, and saw that it was the Killing Curse.

</p><p>Before leaving, Tom also took the <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_Ring" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s Ring">family signet ring</a> from Morfin and wore it like a trophy at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, which led Morfin to lament how his father would kill him for losing the ring for the rest of his life.

<p>Morfin was described as having thick hair matted with dirt, missing teeth, and small dark eyes that stared in opposite directions, the latter suggesting signs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Strabismus">strabismus</a>. <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> thought such an appearance could be humorous, but instead Morfin looked frighteningly deranged.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP10_1-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP10-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Generations of <a href="/wiki/Inbreeding" title="Inbreeding">inbreeding</a> in the Gaunt family caused numerous defects within Morfin, rendering him an overall violent and deranged individual. Morfin shared the same ideology with his father and liked to torture and hex Muggles, without caring about the law, the community, or anyone else, except for his father, whom he respected, because they were both violent and <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood_supremacy" title="Pure-blood supremacy">pure-blood supremacists</a>. As Merope was a <a href="/wiki/Blood_traitor" title="Blood traitor">blood traitor</a>, Morfin was very disrespectful and abusive to her. After her departure from the shack, he brutally insulted her and called her a thief for stealing the <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Locket" class="mw-redirect" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Locket">locket heirloom</a>. Furthermore, Morfin was sadistic, as he liked to torture <a href="/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snakes</a>, nailing them to the door, despite his <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">ancestor</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">affinity</a> towards them. At least <a href="/wiki/Morfin_Gaunt%27s_first_snake" title="Morfin Gaunt&#39;s first snake">one snake</a> of his suffered this fate and he threatened a <a href="/wiki/Morfin_Gaunt%27s_second_snake" title="Morfin Gaunt&#39;s second snake">second</a> with it.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP10_1-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP10-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The Gaunt residence degraded into further squalor when Morfin lived by himself. Morfin had been dependent on Merope to care for the house, albeit not to the extent his father had been. After his sister's death, Morfin had no choice but to be the new housekeeper, although he did a very poor job at it as his home was filled with clutter, mould, and half-eaten food that he took a long time to motivate himself to dispose of some of the mess. Morfin, being a social outcast from the wizarding world, presumably did not throw many parties at his home nor have many guests, and as such felt little need to keep up appearances. One of his few guests, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a>, was disgusted by Morfin's slovenly appearance. Riddle had not anticipated meeting a vulgar slob when he met the Gaunt patriarch, his image of the heads of pure-blood families being akin to the likes of their ancestor or the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Black" title="House of Black">House of Black</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP17_4-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP17-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Ironically, Riddle's framing of his uncle caused the extinction of the pure-blood House of Gaunt. Morfin's subsequent imprisonment ruined any idea of the final patriarch of the Gaunts continuing the bloodline. Admittedly, Morfin would have probably been the last patriarch even if he lived a free man. Morfin's penury, as well as his vulgar attitude, violent disposition and slovenly personal appearance, did not make him a very desirable catch to witches looking for husbands, and Morfin's <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood_supremacist" class="mw-redirect" title="Pure-blood supremacist">pure-blood supremacist</a> views limited his own pool of potential mates considerably.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP17_4-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP17-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Having his <a href="/wiki/Memory" title="Memory">memory</a> <a href="/wiki/False_memory_charm" class="mw-redirect" title="False memory charm">modified</a> by his nephew, Morfin came to be proud of committing murder and allowed himself to be incarcerated without a struggle as he once had against Ogden.

<p>It is unknown if Morfin had met <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle Snr</a> in person, but it is known that Morfin watched him from a far distance before he <a href="/wiki/Hive-conjuring_spell" title="Hive-conjuring spell">hexed</a> him because he noticed his sister romantically looking at him. He most likely hated him even more when he found out that the two had gotten married.

<p>Morfin's relationship with his nephew, Tom Riddle is unknown. They did not know each other well since Riddle had spent his life in a <a href="/wiki/Wool%27s_orphanage" class="mw-redirect" title="Wool&#39;s orphanage">Muggle orphanage</a> and Morfin most likely never knew about his sister's pregnancy nor made any effort to claim guardianship of his sole blood relative. Riddle didn't care about Morfin and deliberately framed him for murdering the <a href="/wiki/Riddle_family" title="Riddle family">Riddle family</a>. Tom's disdain for his uncle Morfin may have been disgust at his squalor or disdain that he never tried to raise him (akin to his father's ignorance), or a combination of both. By taking <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_Ring" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s Ring">Marvolo Gaunt's Ring</a> from Morfin, he rendered his uncle to become depressed with losing the last family heirloom for the rest of his life.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP17_4-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP17-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In the summer of <a href="/wiki/1943" title="1943">1943</a>, Morfin seemed to not know that he had encountered his half-blood nephew (the son of his '<a href="/wiki/Blood_traitor" title="Blood traitor">blood traitor</a> sister' and the '<a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">filthy Muggle</a>' he attacked 18 years earlier). At the moment he saw Riddle, he thought it was Tom Riddle Snr but then realised it wasn't because he suddenly started speaking <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parseltongue</a>. Although Gaunt answered Riddle's questions, he got rather annoyed that the boy even would walk in to start asking such things. After having his memory modified by his nephew, Morfin did not remember anything from the night before and was wrongfully convicted by the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> for the murder of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle Snr</a> and his parents. It could be surmised that after Albus Dumbledore discovered the truth and reinstated Morfin's proper memory of the Riddle murders Morfin Gaunt realised he had come into contact with, and been tragically deceived by, his sister's only son. It's unknown if Morfin lived long enough to see that his nephew grew up to be Lord Voldemort, or if he would've known them to be the same person.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP17_4-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP17-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>It's also quite possible that it was indeed Riddle's intent to put an end to the House of Gaunt. Disgusted by the vulgar appearance of Morfin, Riddle could have been motivated to finish this "disgrace" connected with Salazar Slytherin, so that Riddle himself would carry on the Slytherin legacy alone.

<ul><li>The name <i>Morfin</i> is a variaton of "Morfey", an Anglo-French surname meaning "ill-omened," or "ill-fated". This could be a reference to either Morfin being "fated" to die for crimes that he did not commit, or how he was effectively the end of the House of Gaunt.</li>
<li><i>Morfin</i> could also come from a variation on <i>Morpheus</i>, the Greek god of rest and dreams, from which the word <i>morphine</i>, a powerful drug administered to people undergoing major surgery to dull pain, dervies. In a sense of irony, Morfin's life was the antithesis of that name, being one of constant physical and emotional pain, partly of his own doing, but chiefly due to being bamboozled by his own nephew.</li></ul>
