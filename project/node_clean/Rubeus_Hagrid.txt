In Hagrid's <a href="/wiki/Third_year" title="Third year">third year</a>, he was framed by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> for the crime of opening the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> and using his pet <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantula</a> to attack several <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> students and eventually killing <a href="/wiki/Myrtle_Warren" title="Myrtle Warren">one of them</a>. Though <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_wand" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s wand">Hagrid's wand</a> was snapped and he was expelled, he was trained as <a href="/wiki/Keeper_of_Keys_and_Grounds" title="Keeper of Keys and Grounds">gamekeeper</a> of Hogwarts and allowed to live on the school grounds at the request of <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>, Hagrid was given the task of reintroducing <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a>. In 1993, Hagrid would assume the post of <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a> professor after the retirement of <a href="/wiki/Silvanus_Kettleburn" title="Silvanus Kettleburn">Professor Silvanus Kettleburn</a>. As a member of both the original and the re-instated <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, Hagrid fought in several battles of the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding Wars</a>, including the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>.

<p>Hagrid's father was thrilled when his son was accepted at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, where Hagrid began his education in <a href="/wiki/1940" title="1940">1940</a> in which he was Sorted into <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor House</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-house_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-house-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> During his <a href="/wiki/1940s" title="1940s">third year</a>, Hagrid acquired one in what would be a long line of dangerous <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_pets" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s pets">pets</a>: a young <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantula</a>, which he named <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>. 
</p><p>That same year, fifth-year student <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a>, who would go on to become Lord Voldemort, opened the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> and unleashed another <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_basilisk" class="mw-redirect" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s basilisk">monster</a>, which Riddle used to attack and petrify a number of <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> students until he finally caused the death of a girl named <a href="/wiki/Myrtle_Warren" title="Myrtle Warren">Myrtle Warren</a>. When the school was threatened with closing, a consequence highly undesired by Riddle, the boy found out about Aragog and turned Hagrid in as the culprit. It likely didn't help that Hagrid had a habit of getting into trouble every other week: he'd once tried raising <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> cubs under his bed and was known to sneak off into the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> to wrestle trolls (both of these statements were likely exaggerations on Riddle's part however). Hagrid protected Aragog and helped him flee to the Forbidden Forest; however, he was shortly thereafter expelled from Hogwarts,<sup id="cite_ref-CoS_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CoS-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> a fate that he was relieved that his father never knew of, having died during Hagrid's second year.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Following his expulsion, the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> forbade Hagrid from practising magic and destroyed his <a href="/wiki/Wand" title="Wand">wand</a>. The then-<a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a> teacher <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, who was convinced that Hagrid was innocent, nonetheless convinced then-Headmaster, <a href="/wiki/Armando_Dippet" title="Armando Dippet">Armando Dippet</a>, to have Hagrid trained for the job of <a href="/wiki/Keeper_of_Keys_and_Grounds" title="Keeper of Keys and Grounds">Gamekeeper</a> and allow the orphan to remain a resident of the school. Hagrid continued to do magic using his <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_umbrella" class="mw-redirect" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s umbrella">pink umbrella</a>, which most likely contained the broken fragments of his wand or perhaps even his entire wand intact.

</p><p>Voldemort's first reign of terror lasted years and turned friends against each other.

<p>After Harry was accepted to Hogwarts in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a>, Hagrid was given the task of finding Harry, as Harry's uncle <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon</a> was doing everything in his power to prevent his nephew from receiving his <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_acceptance_letter" title="Hogwarts acceptance letter">Hogwarts acceptance letter</a>. On Harry's <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_eleventh_birthday" title="Harry Potter&#39;s eleventh birthday">eleventh birthday</a>, Hagrid found the Dursleys and Harry in an extremely isolated <a href="/wiki/Hut-on-the-Rock" title="Hut-on-the-Rock">Hut-on-the-Rock</a>, and accidentally broke the door down from the force of his knocking, much to Vernon and <a href="/wiki/Petunia_Dursley" title="Petunia Dursley">Petunia</a>'s intense displeasure; Vernon threatened him with a gun, demanding that he leave, only for Hagrid to contemptuously seize the gun and twist it into a knot like it was rubber.
</p><p>Not only did Hagrid show Harry some of the first real kindness he had ever known, bringing him a <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_birthday_cake_from_Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Harry Potter&#39;s birthday cake from Rubeus Hagrid">birthday cake</a> and generally caring about Harry's comfort and happiness in a way the Dursleys would never have even considered, but he also revealed to Harry that he was a <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a>. Hagrid several times came close to losing his temper with Vernon due to repeated insults against magic. He finally really lost it when Vernon dared to insult Albus Dumbledore, calling him a "crackpot old fool". In retaliation, he attempted to turn Harry's spoiled bully of a cousin, <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley</a>, <a href="/wiki/Human-to-pig_spell" class="mw-redirect" title="Human-to-pig spell">into a pig</a>, but only managed to give the boy a pig's tail. However, Hagrid credited this to Dudley being so much like a pig already, that there was not much left to do.

<p>Harry, knowing that Hagrid had always wanted a dragon and thinking it far too much a coincidence that a man just happened to bring a rare dragon egg to the local pub, questioned Hagrid alongside Ron and Hermione about what had exactly happened during the card game. This time, Hagrid let slip to the trio what he had told the hooded man: the secret to calming Fluffy was that one simply had to play music and Fluffy would fall asleep. This allowed the trio to pursue the potential thief.
</p><p>Once the dragon egg hatched, Hagrid lovingly named the hatchling <a href="/wiki/Norberta" title="Norberta">Norbert</a>. Hagrid was initially blind to the chaos that the hatchling caused, but eventually, Harry, Ron, and Hermione convinced him to allow Norbert to be taken to a <a href="/wiki/Romanian_Dragon_Sanctuary" title="Romanian Dragon Sanctuary">dragon sanctuary</a> by friends of Ron's brother, <a href="/wiki/Charles_Weasley" title="Charles Weasley">Charlie</a>, who worked with dragons. After learning that Voldemort had attempted to steal the Stone using the information Hagrid gave him while drunk, Hagrid was distraught with guilt, but Harry assured Hagrid that he did not blame him. As an apology, Hagrid spent the time that Harry was unconscious sending off owls to some of his parents' old school friends, assembling an album full of wizarding photos of Harry's parents for him.

<p>In the <a href="/wiki/1993%E2%80%931994_school_year" title="1993–1994 school year">1993-1994 school year</a>, Hagrid became a professor of the <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a>. For his first lesson, Hagrid taught his third-year students about <a href="/wiki/Hippogriff" title="Hippogriff">hippogriffs</a>. After explaining the proper way to greet a hippogriff and choosing Harry to demonstrate, <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> caused trouble by insulting the hippogriff <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a>, even though Hagrid had just warned the class to treat the creatures with respect.

Buckbeak's attack on Malfoy was later used during the Triwizard Tournament by Rita Skeeter to give Hagrid a very bad reputation.

<p>When <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> learned of <a href="/wiki/Return_of_the_Dark_Lord" class="mw-redirect" title="Return of the Dark Lord">Voldemort's rebirth</a>, he sent Hagrid and <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Madame Maxime</a> as envoys to the <a href="/wiki/Giant_colony" title="Giant colony">giant colonies</a> of north-eastern <a href="/wiki/Minsk" title="Minsk">Minsk</a>, in the hopes of dissuading the giants from joining <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>'s side in the coming war. Bearing gifts of eternal <a href="/wiki/Gubraithian_Fire" title="Gubraithian Fire">Gubraithian Fire</a> and a <a href="/wiki/Goblin-made_battle_helmet" title="Goblin-made battle helmet">goblin-made battle helmet</a>, they eventually won over the <a href="/wiki/Gurg" title="Gurg">Gurg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Karkus" title="Karkus">Karkus</a>.
</p><p>However, two <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> that Voldemort had sent on the same mission engineered an uprising. This uprising was led by the giant <a href="/wiki/Golgomath" title="Golgomath">Golgomath</a>, who beheaded Karkus and usurped his position. Golgomath then ordered his subordinates to attack Hagrid and Maxime and forced them to flee. Golgomath was far more keen towards the Death Eaters and got on well with <a href="/wiki/Walden_Macnair" title="Walden Macnair">Walden Macnair</a>, both of whom enjoyed killing and had shared a dislike toward Hagrid. Hagrid subsequently found that his mother had died years ago, and the existence of his half-brother <a href="/wiki/Grawp" title="Grawp">Grawp</a>, who was having a hard time within his colony as he was considerably smaller than most giants. Hagrid insisted on bringing Grawp back to Hogwarts due to this and presumably to prevent Grawp from being enslaved by Voldemort alongside the other giants. Grawp, however, was highly resistant to the idea and had a general tendency to be violent. Thus Hagrid and Grawp made the journey back to Scotland separately from Madam Maxime.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>

<p>About halfway through the <a href="/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year" title="1995–1996 school year">school year</a>, Hagrid returned from his mission for Dumbledore with his half-brother, <a href="/wiki/Grawp" title="Grawp">Grawp</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> was brought in as the new <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor, and later became the first and only <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_High_Inquisitor" title="Hogwarts High Inquisitor">Hogwarts High Inquisitor</a>. Hagrid barely excused himself for his long absence from Umbridge's tyrannical questioning and was surprised that he would be subjected to her inspection soon afterwards.
</p><p>Hagrid resumed his teaching post, beginning with a lesson about <a href="/wiki/Thestral" title="Thestral">Thestrals</a>. Despite their rather off-putting appearance and the inability of most of the class to see them, Hermione found these lessons far more useful than Hagrid's typical classes. Regardless, early in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, Professor Umbridge put Hagrid on <a href="/wiki/Probation" title="Probation">probation</a> after supposedly finding his lessons unsatisfactory by her standards, despite Hermione's every effort to make sure Hagrid's curriculum was geared toward preparing students for the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Ordinary_Wizarding_Level" title="Ordinary Wizarding Level">O.W.L.s</a>. Umbridge's harsh judgement was largely due to her distaste for "<a href="/wiki/Half-breed" title="Half-breed">half-breeds</a>," and it was only the resistance she met from Headmaster Dumbledore that kept her from firing Hagrid altogether. When confronted by the trio about this revelation, Hagrid attempted to make light of it (nearly concussing Professor Vector with his fist as she went past) but was consistently jumpy and nervous at the prospect of being sacked.

<p>However, once Dumbledore was forced to leave in order to shield Harry from punishment for establishing <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>, Hagrid feared that he would be driven out by the new Headmistress Umbridge. In preparation for this, he introduced Harry and Hermione to Grawp. Grawp took an immediate liking to Hermione, whom he called "Hermy," and Hagrid asked the two of them, along with Ron, to take care of Grawp in his absence.
</p><p>Upon Dumbledore's departure, general chaos reigned within the school, as the students became determined to make Umbridge's job as hard for her as possible; <a href="/wiki/Lee_Jordan" title="Lee Jordan">Lee Jordan</a> even released a couple of <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">nifflers</a> into her office, for which she blamed Hagrid.

Hagrid refused to go quietly and took on the officials, whose attempts to Stun him proved fruitless thanks to his giant blood. Fang came to his master's aid until one of the wizards Stunned him, prompting Hagrid to lift the culprit bodily from the ground and throw the unfortunate soul ten feet away.

<p><a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> had helped Hagrid make several adjustments to the bike, including adding a button that produced dragon's fire, one that produced a net, and another that produced a solid wall, all of which materialised behind the bike by expanding out of its exhaust pipe. As it turned out, the Death Eaters had found out about the plan to move Harry earlier than rumoured (as the Order had purposely released false information about moving him at a later date) and the seven Harrys, with their Order protectors, were ambushed.
</p><p>Hagrid was able to keep the Death Eaters at bay with the help of the modifications on his bike and Harry's wand-work, but when Harry discovered one of the attacking Death Eaters was an <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">imperiused</a> <a href="/wiki/Stanley_Shunpike" title="Stanley Shunpike">Stanley Shunpike</a>, he made the unusual move of using the <a href="/wiki/Disarming_Charm" title="Disarming Charm">Disarming Charm</a>.

In the struggle that followed, the motorcycle was torn apart and Hagrid dove off the bike at a Death Eater, falling a great distance to the ground. He survived, however, as did Harry, when it turned out they had fallen into the protection surrounding the <a href="/wiki/Tonks_house" title="Tonks house">Tonks house</a>.
</p><p>Nymphadora Tonks' parents, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Tonks" title="Edward Tonks">Ted</a> and <a href="/wiki/Andromeda_Tonks" title="Andromeda Tonks">Andromeda Tonks</a>, healed their injuries, as Hagrid comforted Harry over the death of his beloved pet owl <a href="/wiki/Hedwig" title="Hedwig">Hedwig</a>, saying she had lived a "good old life." Since Hagrid had a history of having trouble keeping secrets, <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a> suspected Hagrid was the one who had unintentionally leaked the date of the intended move, although Harry refused to blame anyone even before that was revealed not to be the case. That same night, Hagrid and all the other members of the Order mourned the death of Alastor Moody, who had been targeted immediately by Voldemort, exactly as Moody anticipated.

<p>Once back at Hogwarts, Hagrid continued his job as gatekeeper and Professor of Care of Magical Creatures. At the request of new headmaster, Severus Snape, Hagrid was placed in charge of students who had been assigned detention. Detention with Hagrid consisted of work in the Forbidden Forest, which was far safer than detention with Amycus and Alecto Carrow. Later that year, Hagrid narrowly escaped arrest after holding a <a href="/wiki/Support_Harry_Potter_party" title="Support Harry Potter party">Support Harry Potter party</a> in his hut.

<p>Hagrid was still working at Hogwarts by <a href="/wiki/2017" title="2017">2017</a>, at 89 years old, owing to the natural longevity of wizardkind, which also meant that he would likely have an extremely long life by Muggle standards.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/2019" title="2019">2019</a>, Hagrid led the members of the then recently established <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Secrecy_Task_Force" title="Statute of Secrecy Task Force">Statute of Secrecy Task Force</a> seeking a career as <a href="/wiki/Magizoologist" title="Magizoologist">Magizoologists</a>, welcoming them by saying that he could sense they were going to sign in as he was able to see that they shared a curious spirit and ensuring them that, although being a Magizoologist was far from easy, they could succeed if they had the spirit to withstand the difficult trials and could recover. He first took them to the Diagon Alley to buy several robes and other essential pieces of equipment required to handle beasts and creatures for increased durability before proceeding to successfully teach the <a href="/wiki/Stamina_Charm" title="Stamina Charm">Stamina Charm</a>, (despite his own being "less-than-perfect"), and allowed them to help him handle several live <a href="/wiki/Fire_Crab" title="Fire Crab">Fire Crabs</a>.

<p>Hagrid was born to a <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a> father and a <a href="/wiki/Giant" title="Giant">giant</a> mother, making him a <a href="/wiki/Half-giant" title="Half-giant">half-giant</a>. As a half-giant, Hagrid possessed great physical strength and endurance, including a resilience against some <a href="/wiki/Spell" title="Spell">spells</a>, though his ability to withstand spells was not as great as that of full giants. He was about twice as tall as an average man, standing at eleven feet, six inches tall<sup id="cite_ref-LE_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LE-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> (too big for an ordinary-sized broomstick) and three times as wide, with a long mane of shaggy black hair and a beard that covered most of his face. Hagrid's hands were as big as dustbin lids and his feet in their boots were like baby dolphins.<sup id="cite_ref-hair_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hair-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> He had dark eyes that glinted like black beetles.<sup id="cite_ref-eyes_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-eyes-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Hagrid's size often makes it difficult for him to enter rooms or buildings that are designed for ordinary sized people or not built with airy or grand designs, such as him not being able to fit easily into the Hospital Wing or the Burrow yet having no trouble moving in the Great Hall.
</p><p>He often wore an exceptionally large <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_moleskin_overcoat" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s moleskin overcoat">moleskin overcoat</a> with several pockets that held many things, though that sometimes caused him to spend a lot of time searching for what he wanted to find. Objects within the pockets have included any number of items, such as mouldy dog biscuits, the key to Harry Potter's <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts</a> <a href="/wiki/Vault_687" title="Vault 687">vault</a>, peppermint humbugs, a squashy package of sausages, a copper kettle, a fire poker, wizard money, a birthday cake, birthday presents, a dirty spotted handkerchief, slug pellets, and a living owl. Hagrid's clothing is largely hand-made due to the descriptions of his clothing as being crafted of animal skin and far too large for a full-blooded or non-hybridised human being.

<p>Hagrid was an incredibly warm, kind-hearted man, and would often forget his exceptional size and strength when patting people on the back. Another of Hagrid's greatest traits was his courage. He was also very loyal to his friends and was ready to defend them or fight for them if necessary. He was particularly loyal to Albus Dumbledore, describing him as a "great man". He would react with fury if anyone dared insult the headmaster and wouldn't hesitate to magically assault or rough up the offender.

<p>Hagrid had a great love of magical creatures, including cross-breeds such as the <a href="/wiki/Blast-Ended_Skrewt" title="Blast-Ended Skrewt">Blast-Ended Skrewt</a>, and had a better relationship with most of the inhabitants of the Forbidden Forest than most people, including the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_Centaur_colony" title="Forbidden Forest Centaur colony">centaurs</a>, though he had little interest in tame magical creatures due to the lack of a challenge they offered. Despite this, he did show a good understanding of such creatures when he returned to his post as <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a> teacher, continuing lessons on <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" title="Unicorn">unicorns</a> after Professor <a href="/wiki/Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank" title="Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank">Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_17-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Unfortunately he tended to overlook the dangers behind certain magical creatures, such as his <a href="/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> <a href="/wiki/Norberta" title="Norberta">Norbert</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-PS_19-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> and his pet Acromantula <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>, which was alleged by Tom Riddle to be the monster of <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">Slytherin</a> in <a href="/wiki/1943" title="1943">1943</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-POA_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> resulting in Hagrid's expulsion from the school. Hagrid never spoke about why he was expelled and would ignore any inquiries about it. Hagrid was fond of creatures in general and seemed to want to own any creature was even slightly fierce — his desires included a <a href="/wiki/Warthog" title="Warthog">warthog</a> and any dragon that he could get his hands on. He tended to give his pets ironic names, such as Fluffy for a vicious three-headed dog, and Fang, an affectionate Boarhound.
</p><p>Hagrid had a fondness for drinks and was sometimes known to be aggressive, especially when people insulted or dishonourably attacked those he cared about.

<p>Despite this, Hagrid was a very sensitive person and was known to burst into tears when someone close to him was harmed or killed, or when he felt responsible for something that put his friends in peril, such as drunkenly telling <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> how to get past his giant three headed dog, <a href="/wiki/Fluffy" title="Fluffy">Fluffy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-PS_19-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>

<p>For a man who was expelled during his third year and rarely used <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a> as a result, Rubeus Hagrid was a rather good <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a>, being considerably advanced, with some of his abilities even comparing to the N.E.W.T.-level academical difficulty. Being a Half-Giant, he also had magical abilities which stemmed from his giant blood, such as great superhuman strength and endurance along with a certain degree of magical resistance. Hagrid's hands-on and outdoor style of living allowed him to acquire other skills such as looking after magical creatures, craftsmanship, crossbowmanship and social networking within the magical community.

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">Magical</a> aptitude</b>: Despite having never graduated from Hogwarts and therefore not being fully trained in the magical arts as well as probably not often practising magic as he wasn't allowed to do so technically in his own admission,<sup id="cite_ref-PS_19-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PS-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> as he had been expelled from Hogwarts and his wand was apparently destroyed some years earlier,<sup id="cite_ref-CoS_16-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CoS-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Hagrid's magical aptitude was clearly astonishing as he proved to be quite accomplished and skilled in magic enough that he was able to successfully conjure moderate levels of powerful magic. He was capable of performing successfully the majority of his spells using <a href="/wiki/Nonverbal_spell" title="Nonverbal spell">non-verbal magic</a> via his umbrella and as his wand was apparently destroyed, he may also have been capable of <a href="/wiki/Wandless_magic" title="Wandless magic">wandless magic</a> as well, both of which only extremely powerful wizards and witches proved capable of using effectively. However, Hagrid's magic was never flawless as he was the only member of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> who could not cast the extremely powerful and difficult <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus Charm</a> and failed to completely transfigure <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley Dursley</a> into a pig, although he admitted that since Dudley was already so close to being a pig with his overweight physique and eating ways, he did not need to transfigure him completely, suggesting that Hagrid may have been able to do it but just chose not to further humiliate Dudley, and repair <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_motorbike" title="Harry Potter&#39;s motorbike">Sirius Black's motorbike</a> which had been heavily damaged during the Battle of the Seven Potters, though it must be noted that he was also struggling to control the motorbike and therefore he may just have been unable to exert enough magic to do so.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a></b>: Hagrid was at least moderately proficient in the field transfiguration, as shown in the Hut-on-the-Rock when he pulled off a partially successful transfiguration when he put a pig's tail <a href="/wiki/Dudley_Dursley" title="Dudley Dursley">Dudley Dursley</a> in a failed attempt to <a href="/wiki/Human_to_pig_spell" title="Human to pig spell">transfigure</a> him into said animal. He could also perform <a href="/wiki/Conjuration" title="Conjuration">conjuration</a>; in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a> he used the <a href="/wiki/Fire-Making_Spell" title="Fire-Making Spell">Fire-Making Spell</a>, while in the Hut-on-the-Rock and in <a href="/wiki/1997" title="1997">1997</a> the <a href="/wiki/Water-Making_Spell" title="Water-Making Spell">Water-Making Spell</a>, to put out a fire in his hut during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">Battle of the Astronomy Tower</a>. This is fairly impressive, as Transfiguration is considered one of the most difficult branches of magic and even experienced wizards struggle with it. In the latter case, however, Harry had to inform him of the incantation for the spell, which Hagrid's response suggested he didn't correctly memorise.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Charm" title="Charm">Charms</a></b>: Hagrid was also accomplished with <a href="/wiki/Charm" title="Charm">Charms</a> as he could cast a <a href="/wiki/Rowboat_spell" title="Rowboat spell">spell</a> of his own that can enchant a boat to move on its own to a destination, which he used to transport himself and Harry back to the mainland from the Hut-on-the-Rock and used it on the Hogwarts boats to transport the first years across the <a href="/wiki/Great_Lake" title="Great Lake">Black Lake</a>. Hagrid was skilled in the <a href="/wiki/Engorgement_Charm" title="Engorgement Charm">Engorgement Charm</a> as he used it to enlarge his pumpkins to a giant size, his success impressing Hermione and Fred and George. Although he admitted to not having perfected it, he was competent enough in the <a href="/wiki/Stamina_Charm" title="Stamina Charm">Stamina Charm</a> to successfully instruct members of the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Secrecy_Task_Force" title="Statute of Secrecy Task Force">Statute of Secrecy Task Force</a> who pursued a profession as a <a href="/wiki/Magizoologist" title="Magizoologist">Magizoologist</a> how to cast them.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Nonverbal_magic" class="mw-redirect" title="Nonverbal magic">Non-verbal magic</a></b>: Hagrid was quite skilled at using non-verbal magic, as shown when he both lit a fire non-verbally and transfigured a pig's tail on Dudley. These spells show that, even though Hagrid never graduated from Hogwarts, he had a powerful command of magic, as non-verbal magic was difficult to use (Hogwarts does not teach non-verbal magic until students are in their sixth year).</li></ul>

<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a></b>: Hagrid was also extremely knowledgeable about magical creatures and was highly skilled in looking after, interacting with, and gaining their trust, including dangerous creatures which likely contributes from his experiences in the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> and with his pets. Hagrid's skill and knowledge in handling creatures allowed him to be the <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a> professor even though he was not a fully qualified wizard. Despite his skill and knowledge, many students considered Professor <a href="/wiki/Grubbly-Plank" class="mw-redirect" title="Grubbly-Plank">Grubbly-Plank</a> a more qualified teacher for the subject as Hagrid preferred teaching dangerous creatures and could lose his confidence if students tried to disrupt his classes or if he believed they did not like his classes. However, when Hagrid stopped dealing with dangerous creatures too much and began to become more experienced in teaching, his skills proved to be impressive enough to make him a reasonable teacher, as he proved to be able to improve all of the students excluding <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> view on him that they all expressed shock that <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> would sack him, although many of them did not choose to continue the subject for <a href="/wiki/Nastily_Exhausting_Wizarding_Test" title="Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test">N.E.W.Ts</a> due to their past experiences with the dangerous creatures he taught. The dangerous and unpredictable creatures which Hagrid taught included <a href="/wiki/Hippogriff" title="Hippogriff">hippogriffs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Blast-Ended_Skrewt" title="Blast-Ended Skrewt">Blast-Ended Skrewts</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Thestral" title="Thestral">thestrals</a>. Although he believed that tame and less harmful magical creatures did not pose many challenges, Hagrid neverthless possessed a remarkable amount of knowledge on them as well as monstrous creatures, enough that he was able to effectively continue Grubbly-Plank's lessons on <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" title="Unicorn">unicorns</a> and he also taught <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">nifflers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Flobberworm" title="Flobberworm">flobberworms</a>. Some of the creatures Hagrid looked after included a three headed dog named <a href="/wiki/Fluffy" title="Fluffy">Fluffy</a>, his pet <a href="/wiki/Boarhound" title="Boarhound">boarhound</a> <a href="/wiki/Fang" title="Fang">Fang</a>, a baby <a href="/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> named <a href="/wiki/Norberta" title="Norberta">Norbert</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantula</a> named <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Hippogriff" title="Hippogriff">hippogriff</a> named <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a> and his half-brother <a href="/wiki/Grawp" title="Grawp">Grawp</a>, who was a <a href="/wiki/Giant" title="Giant">giant</a>. While his teaching methods were questionable, his knowledge helped Harry and his friends on numerous occasions, such as when they got past Fluffy while protecting the Philosopher's Stone, helped <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> escape on Buckbeak, faced a Blast-Ended Skrewt during the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, and went to the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> using Thestrals. It should also be noted that his knowledge was such that he was initially the only person apart from Dumbledore who knew how to subdue Fluffy through music as even <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> was unable to get past Fluffy without getting injured, and <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a>, under Voldemort's influence, had to gather the secret from a drunken Hagrid on how to get past Fluffy (which Harry, Ron and Hermione later learnt) especially considering Voldemort and Snape were both already highly powerful and intelligent wizards even in their youths while Quirrell had experience with handling dangerous animals like trolls. Hagrid was skilled enough to gradually earn the respect and loyalty of Grawp, despite the protests of Harry, Ron, Hermione and Firenze, along with Grawp's violent nature. Hagrid's knowledge in dealing with giants and other dangerous magical creatures also made Dumbledore order Hagrid to go and attempt to recruit the giants to fight against Voldemort, which he would have succeeded if not for the Death Eaters' interference and <a href="/wiki/Golgomath" title="Golgomath">Golgomath</a>'s usurpation of the current Gurg, <a href="/wiki/Karkus" title="Karkus">Karkus</a>. Due to his friendship with Aragog, Hagrid was the only person who was able to visit the Acromantula tribe in the Forbidden Forest without being harmed, although this was lost after Aragog's death. Up until he rescued <a href="/wiki/Firenze" title="Firenze">Firenze</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_Centaur_colony" title="Forbidden Forest Centaur colony">Forbidden Forest Centaur colony</a>, Hagrid was among the very few that they respected and trusted, as he was able to visit them and interact with them cordially and <a href="/wiki/Torvus" title="Torvus">Torvus</a> even noted that Hagrid held enough influence that if <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> was a friend of Hagrid, the Centaurs would consider trusting them as well and it was his advice that eventually allowed the student to earn their respect. Grubbly-Plank also noted that Hagrid had the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Thestral_herd" title="Hogwarts Thestral herd">Hogwarts thestrals</a> well trained so that they didn't touch owls even though they were noted to have occasionally gone after birds. This talent also helped him as he was trusted with leading the <a href="/wiki/Magizoologist" title="Magizoologist">Magizoologist</a> faction of the <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Secrecy_Task_Force" title="Statute of Secrecy Task Force">Statute of Secrecy Task Force</a> and had efficiently taught the recruits how to handle beasts safely. This can all indicate that Hagrid was a considerably talented person on the subject and this was clearly his strongest subject, possessing more knowledge than even wizards who were more powerful and intelligent, despite lacking the qualifications along with the teaching experience and understanding to fully engage his students.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Potion" title="Potion">Potions</a></b>: Altough not a well known skill of his and his actual level as a potion maker is unknown, Hagrid displayed a remarkable amount of knowledge in the subject. When he asked <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> to brew the <a href="/wiki/Fire-Breathing_Potion" title="Fire-Breathing Potion">Fire-Breathing Potion</a> in order to burn the Devil Snare holding Fang in the year 1985, he was able to thoroughly explain to the student all the ingredients needed to brew the potion and was aware that mint had cooling properties that would allow them to consume it without harming themselves.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Superhuman_strength" title="Superhuman strength">Superhuman strength</a></b>: Due to his giant blood, Hagrid possessed great levels of superhuman strength, as shown when <a href="/wiki/Vernon_Dursley" title="Vernon Dursley">Vernon Dursley</a> threatened Hagrid with a gun and Hagrid responded by easily twisting his gun to a knot as if the gun was made of rubber. Hagrid's great strength was also shown when, during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, he threw Walden Macnair across the Great Hall, a space which can easily fit all the students and staff at Hogwarts. The great strength of Hagrid was also seen whenever he tried to gently pat someone on the back, an act which usually sent the recipient flying. His strength also helped, given the kind of creatures he tended to look after, such as Fluffy, a gigantic three-headed dog, a 10-foot long Blast-Ended Skrewt and <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantula</a> the size of a small elephant (though seeing as he was Hagrid's friend, he might not have been that bad to look after). Hagrid's strength also proved to be a big advantage when in battle and a powerful blow from Hagrid could badly injure and knock a person unconscious instantly as shown during his battle with some <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>. It is also possible that Hagrid was capable of killing a person or animal with powerful blows from his great strength alone, although this was rarely shown as conflicts with enemies were rare for Hagrid. Given Hagrid's absurd ease in handling creatures as large as Acromantulas, three-headed dogs, and his half-brother, Grawp, it can be safe to assume that Hagrid is capable of lifting well over ten-thousand pounds and exerting far more force in combat. Hagrid was also able to control Madame Maxime's horses which were each described as being the size of an elephant and required forceful handling. Hagrid's own massive size would take extreme power just to be able to move, so for him to be able to move as effortlessly as he does, let alone exert his strength as he does must mean that his strength is enhanced by magical means as well as physical. In fact, his strength was such that he was described to have wrestled <a href="/wiki/Troll" title="Troll">trolls</a> in the Forbidden Forest <i>as a boy</i>. Hagrid also regularly hauls in the massive Hogwarts Christmas trees simultaneously by himself with no discernible strain, even though each one weighs at least several thousand pounds based on their described height and probable species. Based on this, the full extent of Hagrid's superhuman strength, while never seen explicitly in the series, most certainly makes him a force of nature in his own right.</li>
<li><b>Superhuman endurance</b>: Hagrid is also known for being able take quite a beating. Due to his outdoorsy line of work, Hagrid is able to exert himself at the peak of his superhuman strength for hours at a time without any known limits to how long he can maintain his stamina. Given that he is capable of keeping up with tutoring and taming his full-giant half-brother, Grawp, and still keep up with his lessons as a Hogwarts Professor, his duties as gamekeeper, maintaining a social life, and his various hobbies of tending to and caring for injured and sick animals in the Forbidden Forest, all while nursing injuries from Grawp, Hagrid certainly has vast levels of superhuman stamina that no other character has matched in the series. Hagrid's bodily tissues are also extremely strong, enhanced due to his giant blood, allowing him to endure beatings from his half-brother that would absolutely kill any ordinary man, regardless of their physical conditioning, although he still experienced visible and rather nasty wounds in the form of bruising and various minor cuts and lacerations throughout his body. Hagrid is also capable of withstanding torture from the likes of Voldemort and his Death Eaters, as evidenced by his maintaining of full consciousness after being captured during the first half of The Battle of Hogwarts.</li>
<li><b>Magical resistance</b>: Hagrid was resistant to stunning spells because of his giant blood. This also gave Hagrid some protection against curses, including moderate levels of <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Magic</a> as even the Death Eaters attempts to curse him after Dumbledore's death failed, which gave him an advantage whenever he was involved in a battle.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Poison" title="Poison">Poison</a> resistance</b>: Due to Hagrid's work with various magical creatures, many of which are venomous and highly likely to carry disease, it can be assumed that Hagrid's magical resistance afforded him a degree of foreign chemical resistance as well. This can also be assumed in part due to his enormous size in accordance with his giant heritage, as toxicity in the body is relative to one's size and the amount of a foreign substance circulating within. This can also be seen in his difficulty with becoming intoxicated, as it took Quirrell several hours to get Hagrid drunk enough to divulge the information of how to get past Fluffy in the first chamber in 1992. In fact, Hagrid's resistance to alcohol toxicity was so strong that he was able to down an entire bottle of brandy in a single swig without any notable effects on his behaviour or cognitive functioning following the Battle of the Seven Potters in 1997. Such a feat would likely be impossible for anyone of entirely human heritage without the aid of magic.</li>
<li><b>Arbalist skills</b>: Hagrid was also a skilled crossbowman, a crossbow being his primary means of defence.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Muggle_duelling" title="Muggle duelling">Physical combat skills</a></b>: Hagrid was highly proficient at fighting physically. This was displayed in 1996 when Hagrid was attacked by <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, along with some Aurors, who attempted to sack and arrest him. Hagrid managed to physically defeat all the Aurors effortlessly, which enabled him to escape from Umbridge. It should be noted that his combat was such that even Umbridge's remaining Auror was hesitant to attack Hagrid. Before that, he also rescued <a href="/wiki/Firenze" title="Firenze">Firenze</a> from the other centaurs in the Forbidden Forest after they attempted to kill him for accepting a <a href="/wiki/Divination_(class)" title="Divination (class)">teaching post</a> in Hogwarts and escaped from the entire Acromantula colony of the Forest to give Aragog a proper burial all without any injuries, which is another testament to Hagrid's combat skills especially as both centaurs and acromantulas were powerful creatures in their own right. Also, in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Hagrid easily physically defeated <a href="/wiki/Walden_Macnair" title="Walden Macnair">Walden Macnair</a> by throwing him across the Great Hall and he survived the battle. As Hagrid rarely used magic, he normally relied on these skills, his great strength, magical and physical endurance and possibly his crossbowman skills to fight in a battle and presumably used his skills to participate in the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First</a> and <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding Wars</a> when he was a member of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>. However, he did occasionally use his umbrella-concealed wand when battling, indicating that he was willing to use magic against his opponents alongside his physical battling abilities when the time was right.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Keeper_of_Keys_and_Grounds" title="Keeper of Keys and Grounds">Gamekeeping skills</a></b>: Hagrid began his training as a Hogwarts Gamekeeper in 1943 after his third-year expulsion, possibly under Gamekeeper <a href="/wiki/Ogg" title="Ogg">Ogg</a>; it is known he would have been Ogg's assistant during the 1960s. Hagrid most likely was an efficient and skilled Keeper of Keys and Grounds as there was no mentioned blunder, replacement or substitute (with the exception of Professor <a href="/wiki/Grubbly-Plank" class="mw-redirect" title="Grubbly-Plank">Grubbly-Plank</a> on two occasions) throughout his time in this position, and was able to keep up this position alongside his teaching duties as the Care of Magical Creatures professor and his duties for the Order of the Phoenix. These duties included escorting first-year students to Hogwarts, looking after the school keys, preparing for the <a href="/wiki/Hallowe%27en_Feast" title="Hallowe&#39;en Feast">Hallowe'en</a> and <a href="/wiki/Christmas_Feast" title="Christmas Feast">Christmas</a> feasts by preparing the pumpkins and Christmas trees respectively, performing secret and special tasks for the other Hogwarts teachers, and tending to matters which would be difficult for ordinary people and wizards to do such as tending to matters in the Forbidden Forest and looking after the magical creatures around the Hogwarts grounds.</li>
<li><b>Cooking skills</b>: Living alone in his cabin, Hagrid cooked for himself, though he would have meals in the Great Hall on occasion, such as the various school feasts. He apparently enjoyed his own food, though, being a half-giant, his tastes often clashed with those of his guests. He has been known to serve such foodstuffs to his guests as <a href="/wiki/Rock_cake" title="Rock cake">rock cakes</a> that were too hard for a normal human to chew and a "<a href="/wiki/Casserole" title="Casserole">beef casserole</a>" that was actually made of some taloned creature. Guests used to his cooking would often respectfully decline his food, even if it was something of his they had never tried, such as when Harry and Ron turned down some <a href="/wiki/Bath_bun" title="Bath bun">Bath buns</a> he had made in 1994. However, one occasion when his cooking was appreciated was when he cooked some sausages for Harry the first time they met at the Hut-On-The-Rock, which Harry noted was tastier than anything he had eaten before starting Hogwarts.</li>
<li><b>Tactical thinking and resourcefulness</b>: Hagrid was also good both at being resourceful and thinking tactically when he was in a serious situation. When <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a> was accused of being <a href="/wiki/Basilisk" title="Basilisk">Slytherin's Monster</a>, Hagrid sent him to the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> to protect him, knowing it was the only safe place for him when Hagrid was expelled on suspicion of opening the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, also preventing Hagrid from getting in further trouble for his possesion of the Acromantula. This was again shown before he was temporarily sent to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> when he sent a coded message to Harry and Ron, indirectly telling them to visit Aragog which, while it was almost fatal, allowed them to discover that Hagrid was innocent and determine the location of the Chamber of Secrets, in turn also resulting in Hagrid's release from Azkaban. Another instance is when he smuggled Grawp into the Forbidden Forest without even Umbridge's attention and tactfully brought Harry and Hermione to see him while the Quidditch Final was taking place, ensuring a distraction for the other Hogwarts residents. He also successfully escaped capture on two occasions by fleeing to the same cave Sirius Black and Buckbeak temporarily lived in: first was when Umbridge tried to get him both sacked and arrested due to her prejudice against Hagrid, and the second was when he was almost caught by the Death Eaters for holding a <a href="/wiki/Support_Harry_Potter_party" title="Support Harry Potter party">Support Harry Potter party</a> during Voldemort's control over Hogwarts, taking Fang with him for both occasions and Grawp on the second occasion. He was also able to successfully determine that Voldemort was going to wage war on Hogwarts when he heard his message to surrender Harry from his cave, allowing him, Grawp and Fang to return to Hogwarts in time before the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> began. His resourcefulness was also demonstrated when he used a <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_moleskin_overcoat" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s moleskin overcoat">moleskin overcoat</a> to carry most of his possessions while travelling, which would be useful in more serious situations if he had to fight in a battle during which he would be unable to carry the majority of his possessions by hand.</li>
<li><b>Extreme dexterity</b>: Given Hagrid's superhuman size and strength, his dexterity and coordination is well above average considering he is able to handle people and objects that are extremely delicate and fragile, such as Harry when he was just a baby without the slightest bit of difficulty. This level of control over his massive form is to the extent that he is able to weave bindings from stray unicorn tail hairs to secure bandages and splints on injured animals that he finds in the Forbidden Forest. Given that unicorn tail hair is an unusually fine material, Hagrid must have amazingly deft hands to be able to craft it in such a way. His lack of control over his strength is usually in response to his emotions, but it can be assumed that given a moment to concentrate he can control his massive bulk enough to achieve incredible manual feats.</li>
<li><b>Craftsmanship skills</b>: Due to Hagrid's hands-on style of living, he has developed great skill at building or creating things by hand, such as his clothes, his cabin, and various other items. He is a fine whittler as he crafted a flute from wood that he gave Harry for his first Christmas at Hogwarts that when played made a sound like an owl. He likely also made his commonly worn moleskin overcoat that contains a wide variety of items. Hagrid also likely built the pen that he used to hold the hippogriffs for his first lesson as Professor of Care of Magical Creatures, in autumn of 1993.</li>
<li><b>Social networking</b>: Due to Hagrid's work in the Order of The Phoenix and his skills at negotiating and making great connections within the magical community, especially with creatures of great pride such as the centaurs, he has great ability to make allies. Dumbledore specially chose Hagrid for this skill to be an envoy to the giants during the summer of 1995. Despite his lack of success due to the Death Eaters' interference and Golgomath's usurpation of the current Gurg, Karkus, Hagrid had great initial strides with the giant colony, showing his impressive social aptitude with magical creatures and beings of all levels of sapience and intellect. He also indirectly convinced the centaurs to fight alongside the reinforcements during the second half of the Battle of Hogwarts after verbally admonishing them for their apparent cowardice, eventually resulting in the defeats of many Death Eaters.</li>
<li><b>Musical skills</b>: While not a very well known skill of his, Hagrid has shown adequate aptitude for music and would sing while enjoying a drink at events like Bill and Fleur Weasley's wedding and after Aragog's funeral. He also possessed enough skill in the area to create the wooden flute he gave Harry for Christmas in 1991, which when played created music that sounded a lot like the hooting of owls. His aptitude in music also helped him when dealing with certain magical creatures, such as being capable of playing a good enough music to easily make Fluffy fall asleep in order to calm him.</li>
<li><b>Teaching skills</b>: At first, due to his nervousness, teaching inexperience and desire to teach more dangerous magical creatures due to believing their greater quality, Hagrid was a poor teacher and his teaching ability was disliked by all, with only Harry, Hermione and Ron supporting him. In his first year as a teacher, his teaching ability was also hampered due to his first lesson being disrupted by Draco Malfoy, along with his concern over Buckbeak's safety after he attacked Malfoy for insulting him. However, over time as he gained more experience and started to teach more excitable creatures, he became good enough that although many of them still chose not to continue Care of Magical Creatures in their N.E.W.Ts, all but Slytherin students no longer complained as much about his teaching and openly admitted Hagrid's improvement, defending his teaching skills when he was sacked by <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, which was to be expected from Umbridge's prejudice towards magical creatures, and expressing shock that it happened. By <a href="/wiki/2019" title="2019">2019</a>, Hagrid had clearly improved reasonably, as he was trusted with teaching members of the highly important <a href="/wiki/Statute_of_Secrecy_Task_Force" title="Statute of Secrecy Task Force">Statute of Secrecy Task Force</a> who wanted to become Magizoologists and was able to do so succesfully, ranging from teaching the <a href="/wiki/Stamina_Charm" title="Stamina Charm">Stamina Charm</a>, despite his less-than-perfect version, and giving them an effective elective regarding magical creatures.</li>
<li><b>Leadership skills</b>: Although mostly taking orders from Dumbledore and after he was gone the other professors, by 2019, Hagrid had clearly became at least a competent enough leader to be trusted with handling the Magizoologist faction of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, which clearly shows considerable leadership, being able to lead a rather large amount of magical beast handlers into handling Foundables that included Beasts without attracting the attention of Muggles.</li></ul>

<p>Rubeus Hagrid was born to <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_father" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s father">Mr Hagrid</a>, a wizard, and the <a href="/wiki/Giant" title="Giant">giantess</a> <a href="/wiki/Fridwulfa" title="Fridwulfa">Fridwulfa</a>. Fridwulfa left the family because her son was "too small" for her liking, though Hagrid never seemed to resent her for abandoning him, generally appearing relatively indifferent about his lack of relationship with her. His father, on the other hand, seemed to be a very caring man who was heartbroken when his wife left, and was amused by the fact that, at the age of six, Hagrid was large enough to be able to set him on top of a dresser.<sup id="cite_ref-gof23_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-gof23-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Mr Hagrid died when his son was twelve years old, and by the time Hagrid tried to find his mother in <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, she too had died, although he dismissed the issue on the grounds that he barely remembered her. On the other hand, he was saddened by his father's death, though he was at least glad that his father did not live to see Rubeus expelled from school.
</p><p>During his travels to the Northern <a href="/wiki/Giant_colony" title="Giant colony">giant colonies</a> that same year, Hagrid found his maternal half-brother: an undersized giant called <a href="/wiki/Grawp" title="Grawp">Grawp</a>. As Grawp's size made it difficult for him to function within his colony, Hagrid brought him back to <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> and hid him within the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>. As Hagrid and Maxime's mission had failed, it is extremely likely that Hagrid also brought Grawp back to prevent his half-brother from being enslaved by Voldemort alongside the other giants. Hagrid's attempts to raise and socialise Grawp initially appeared completely pointless; Grawp's progress in picking up English, or in curbing his violence, which often left Hagrid with a number of painful looking injuries, seemed almost non-existent.
</p><p>However, over the course of the year, Grawp grew increasingly attached to his older brother and was distressed by Hagrid's disappearance after <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> attempted to have Hagrid arrested in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_17-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> By <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Funeral_of_Albus_Dumbledore" title="Funeral of Albus Dumbledore">funeral</a>, Grawp was relatively calm and presentable, and he even attempted to comfort Hagrid by patting him (though a bit too hard) on the head and later embracing him.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP_25-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Grawp spent the first part of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> stumbling around, yelling for "Hagger," but eventually jumped into the fray, fighting the giants brought to the battle by Voldemort.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_26-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Hagrid had a good relationship with most of his pets and other magical creatures, most notably <a href="/wiki/Fang" title="Fang">Fang</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a>. His relationship with most magical creatures was arguably better then the ones most other wizards had. 
</p><p>Fang was usually Hagrid's companion most of the time, although he was cowardly. Fang demonstrated some protectiveness towards Hagrid in spite of his cowardly nature such as when he attempted to protect Hagrid when Dolores Umbridge and some Auror's attempted to sack and arrest him. Hagrid, in turn, was also protective of Fang as he was enraged when the Aurors had stunned him, carrying his unconscious body as he fled Hogwarts, and immediately went after Fang when he was afraid during the Battle of Hogwarts. 
</p><p>Hagrid had a huge friendship with Aragog, whom he had hatched in an egg when he was a student at Hogwarts. Hagrid protected Aragog when he was suspected to be the <a href="/wiki/Slytherin%27s_Basilisk" class="mw-redirect" title="Slytherin&#39;s Basilisk">monster</a> that opened the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, throwing <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> to the ground when he tried to curse him and sending Aragog to live in the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>. Hagrid managed to find Aragog a wife, <a href="/wiki/Mosag" title="Mosag">Mosag</a>, which allowed Aragog to have a family in the forest. Aragog, in turn, was grateful for Hagrid's friendship and protection to the point that he never directly harmed a human out of respect for Hagrid and commanded his family not to harm Hagrid while he was alive. However, this did not stop Aragog from letting his children and descendants attempt to eat Harry and Ron even though they were friends of Hagrid, claiming that he could not deny them fresh meat when it wandered into their midst. Hagrid was devastated when Aragog died and, along with Professor Slughorn, buried him near his Hut. Although Aragog's children and descendants did not hold back in attempting to devour Hagrid after Aragog's death, Hagrid attempted to protect them during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> in honour of his friendship with Aragog, even though the Acromantulas were attacking both Death Eaters and Hogwarts defenders.
</p><p>Hagrid cared greatly about Buckbeak as he tried hard to prevent his execution by the Ministry of Magic and was overjoyed when he managed to escape with <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>. Hagrid also looked after Buckbeak after Sirius was killed by Bellatrix. Hagrid briefly had a pet dragon named <a href="/wiki/Norberta" title="Norberta">Norbert</a>, although since dragons were illegal, Hagrid reluctantly allowed Norbert to be sent to Charlie in Romania. Hagrid also owned a three-headed dog named <a href="/wiki/Fluffy" title="Fluffy">Fluffy</a>, although it is unknown what relationship he had with him.
</p><p>Hagrid also had a cordial relationship with the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_Centaur_colony" title="Forbidden Forest Centaur colony">Forbidden Forest Centaur colony</a>, especially with <a href="/wiki/Bane" title="Bane">Bane</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ronan" title="Ronan">Ronan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Magorian" title="Magorian">Magorian</a> and <a href="/wiki/Firenze" title="Firenze">Firenze</a>, and sometimes visited them whenever he went inside the Forest. However, Hagrid had a falling out with the centaurs when he defended Firenze from them as they believed Firenze had betrayed them by accepting the teaching post of <a href="/wiki/Divination" title="Divination">Divination</a> at Hogwarts, which was further complicated when he brought Grawp into the Forbidden Forest. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, when Hagrid carried Harry, believing he was dead, back to Hogwarts, he was furious when the centaurs did not fight in the first half for Harry, accusing them of cowardice, which convinced them to fight in the second half of the battle. While Hagrid remained on good terms with Firenze, it is unknown whether Hagrid made peace with the other Centaurs after the battle ended.

<p>Harry Potter and Hagrid shared a special relationship. Hagrid was one of the first people (if not the first) Harry could remember showing him genuine kindness and appearing to truly care for him. Hagrid was the one who introduced Harry back into the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a>, and he empathised with Harry's situation, as they were both a bit different from wizarding norm and were orphans who had been more or less left to fend for themselves.

<p>Hagrid was Harry's first true friend, and the two helped each other get through many difficult situations and constantly looked out for one another. Though Harry often took issue with Hagrid's penchant for collecting dangerous <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_pets" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s pets">pets</a>, as well as the fact Hagrid decided to bring his <a href="/wiki/Giant" title="Giant">giant</a> <a href="/wiki/Grawp" title="Grawp">half-brother</a> to Hogwarts,<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_17-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> he never failed to support Hagrid in his efforts to protect and care for all of them.   
</p><p>When Harry learned about Hagrid's half-giant status, he never showed any concern about it, citing his relationship to the Dursleys as an example of how people should not be judged by who they were related to but who they were themselves. Hagrid's kindness and friendship allowed Harry to come to terms with how being an orphan never leaves you, as Harry witnessed Hagrid still mourning his father's death even over fifty years since he passed. This bond between two orphans and Hagrid's reassurance that Harry's parents would be proud of him helped Harry to live with pride in his family. Hagrid was also the one who first told Harry about who his parents were and gave him his first true look at his heritage and family.  
</p><p>Hagrid was shocked and horrified when Harry came to Voldemort to be sacrificed and yelled at him to run. Hagrid was devastated when he thought Harry was dead and openly sobbed in front of the Death Eaters and rebuked the <a href="/wiki/Centaur" title="Centaur">centaurs</a> for not helping Harry. Hagrid returned Harry to the forest and was very gentle with his body. Hagrid was delighted when he found Harry was alive and was among the first people to congratulate Harry after he defeated Voldemort for the final time. 
</p><p>Hagrid also met <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> through Harry, and he presumably remained in touch with all three of them well after their time at Hogwarts, as in <a href="/wiki/2017" title="2017">2017</a>, Harry reminded his son, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus</a>, that he had been invited to <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_cabin" class="mw-redirect" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s cabin">Hagrid's hut</a> for tea upon his arrival at Hogwarts.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_26-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> In many ways, Hagrid served as a pillar of strength for Harry, giving him his first look at just how kind people can be, and gave Harry his first taste of kindness, which caught on like wildfire and served to groom Harry into the selfless guardian and warrior he became. Suffice it to say, were it not for Hagrid, Harry could have ended up a profoundly different person.

<p>Like <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry</a>, both Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley had a close relationship with the half-giant. Though Ron was openly outraged by some of Hagrid's more dangerous <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_pets" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s pets">pets</a>, particularly <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>, Hermione was more reserved with her comments and tended to be more proactive than either Ron or Harry when it came to helping Hagrid protect his creatures. She tried desperately to help him appeal <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a>'s death sentence in <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-POA_23-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> and in her <a href="/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year" title="1995–1996 school year">fifth year</a>, she made every effort to ensure sure Hagrid's <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a> curriculum would give <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> no excuse to sack him.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_17-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a> revealed that Hagrid was half-giant in the <i>Daily Prophet</i>, both Ron and Hermione stood by him and convinced him that despite all the prejudice he faced, there were still people who loved him and wanted him to stay at the school. Hagrid was on the point of resigning, but with their encouragement, remained at Hogwarts and continued teaching. Ron did show a certain level of concern upon learning of Hagrid's shock, given wizarding history regarding giants; Hermione, on the other hand, noted in an unsurprising tone that she suspected it long ago, seeing as his size fit the profile.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF_24-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Hagrid came to Hermione's defence during her <a href="/wiki/1993%E2%80%931994_school_year" title="1993–1994 school year">third year</a> when she was in conflict with the boys (as Ron believed her <a href="/wiki/Crookshanks" title="Crookshanks">cat</a> had eaten his rat <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Scabbers</a>, and Harry was angry that she had gotten his <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_Firebolt" title="Harry Potter&#39;s Firebolt">Firebolt</a> confiscated). Hagrid was able to convince Harry and Ron of how poorly they were treating their friend, and eventually, he succeeded in getting the two to reconcile with Hermione.<sup id="cite_ref-POA_23-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> He also encouraged Hermione during her <a href="/wiki/1994-1995_school_year" class="mw-redirect" title="1994-1995 school year">fourth year</a> to ignore the hate mail as he had following Rita Skeeter releasing a nasty article about Hermione in <i><a href="/wiki/Witch_Weekly" title="Witch Weekly">Witch Weekly</a></i>.
It is possible that Hagrid was close with Ron and Hermione's daughter, <a href="/wiki/Rose_Granger-Weasley" title="Rose Granger-Weasley">Rose Granger-Weasley</a> and their son <a href="/wiki/Hugo_Granger-Weasley" title="Hugo Granger-Weasley">Hugo Granger-Weasley</a>, as he was planning to have tea with Harry's son, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Potter" title="Albus Potter">Albus</a>, in <a href="/wiki/2017" title="2017">2017</a>.

<p>Hagrid was two years below <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, and in Hagrid's <a href="/wiki/1940s" title="1940s">third year</a>, Riddle opened the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, unleashing a <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_Basilisk" class="mw-redirect" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s Basilisk">Basilisk</a> on <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> students. After the death of <a href="/wiki/Myrtle_Warren" title="Myrtle Warren">Myrtle Warren</a>, Hogwarts was in danger of closing, and to prevent that happening, Riddle framed Hagrid and his pet <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantula</a>, <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>, for the crime. Hagrid protected Aragog from Riddle, throwing him to the ground when he tried to curse Aragog, making Hagrid the only person to challenge Riddle while he was a student. Despite this, Hagrid was expelled from Hogwarts and had his <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_wand" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s wand">wand</a> snapped in half by the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-CoS_16-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CoS-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Believing in Hagrid's innocence, however, Professor <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> convinced Headmaster <a href="/wiki/Armando_Dippet" title="Armando Dippet">Armando Dippet</a> to allow Hagrid to stay on at Hogwarts as <a href="/wiki/Keeper_of_Keys_and_Grounds" title="Keeper of Keys and Grounds">Gamekeeper</a>.
</p><p>Tom Riddle never felt remorse for framing Hagrid and ruining his life. As Riddle went on to become Lord Voldemort, Hagrid joined the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> to fight against Voldemort and his <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. In <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a>, Hagrid was devastated by the <a href="/wiki/Attack_at_Godric%27s_Hollow_(1981)" title="Attack at Godric&#39;s Hollow (1981)">murder</a> of his friends <a href="/wiki/James_and_Lily_Potter" title="James and Lily Potter">James and Lily Potter</a> but was relieved when the Dark Lord disappeared after failing to kill young <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>. Although many thought that Voldemort was dead, Hagrid, agreeing with Dumbledore, believed that he would return one day, as he believed that he did not "<i>have enough human left in him to die</i>". As with most of the wizarding community, he refused to speak Voldemort's name, and generally referred to him as "You-Know-Who." However, when he first explained Voldemort's background to Harry, he reluctantly said Voldemort's name. When Voldemort was searching for the Philosopher's Stone, he took advantage of Hagrid's love and knowledge of magical creatures and through Quirinus Quirrell, gathered the secret of subduing <a href="/wiki/Fluffy" title="Fluffy">Fluffy</a> through music from a drunken Hagrid, who was remorseful afterwards. Since Voldemort had a certain respect for Hogwart's professors, it is not known if that included Hagrid, who taught <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a>. This is unlikely considering Hagrid's half-giant status.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, after his resurrection, Voldemort dispatched his Death Eaters to convince the <a href="/wiki/Giant" title="Giant">giants</a> to join their side, while Dumbledore had sent Hagrid and <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Olympe Maxime</a> to do the same. While Hagrid and Maxime were on good terms with the Gurg, <a href="/wiki/Karkus" title="Karkus">Karkus</a>, the Death Eaters supported the giant <a href="/wiki/Golgomath" title="Golgomath">Golgomath</a> in an uprising that resulted in Golgomath beheading Karkus and taking over the giant colony. The giants then attacked Hagrid and Maxime, who were forced to retreat.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, Hagrid fought in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> and was captured by the Death Eaters. After Harry sacrificed himself to be killed, Voldemort ordered a grieving Hagrid to carry his friend's "dead" body in his arms, where it would be clearly visible to Harry's supporters. On the way back to the school, Hagrid expressed his fury with the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_Centaur_colony" title="Forbidden Forest Centaur colony">centaurs</a> for staying out of the fight, prompting them to join in soon after.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_26-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> Hagrid was among the first to congratulate Harry after his defeat of Voldemort, showing his disdain for the Dark Lord. It was never confirmed if he knew or would know that his former classmate and the Dark Lord were one and the same, however, since Hagrid said to Harry in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a> that Voldemort was in Slytherin, it is likely that Hagrid knew.

<p>Hagrid was good friends with <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>, though it is uncertain as to when they first met, Arthur and Molly not having been in the original <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>. He was most likely assistant or co- gamekeeper when Mr and Mrs Weasley were at school, because of the Ogg timeline discrepancy.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Arthur and Molly would have attended nearly two decades later (1960s). He met them again in <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, at <a href="/wiki/Flourish_and_Blotts" title="Flourish and Blotts">Flourish and Blotts</a>, when Arthur got into a fist fight with <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a>. Hagrid broke up the fight and told Arthur that he should have ignored Malfoy, though he clearly sympathised with Arthur on acting the feelings Malfoy went out of his way to inspire. Hagrid was fond of the Weasley's due to their kind nature, immense courage, and their fair-minded views on Muggle-borns and half-humans like himself. 
</p><p>Twins <a href="/wiki/Fred_and_George_Weasley" title="Fred and George Weasley">Fred and George Weasley</a> were friends of Hagrid since their time at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. Hagrid seemed to be one of their favourite members of the staff, as he had a sense of humour and was not anywhere near as strict as many of the professors, though he mentioned that he spent "half his life" chasing the twins away from the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>.
Hagrid also knew <a href="/wiki/Charles_Weasley" title="Charles Weasley">Charles Weasley</a> quite well; Charlie had been one of the best <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a> students in his time at Hogwarts, and Hagrid described him as being "great with animals." He went on to study <a href="/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragons</a> in <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>, and Hagrid helped him with the dragons imported to <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a> in <a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>. Two years earlier, Hagrid had sent his pet dragon, "<a href="/wiki/Norberta" title="Norberta">Norbert</a>" to Charlie in <a href="/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>, and Charlie later informed Hagrid that "Norbert" was, in fact, actually "Norberta."
</p><p><a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a> also attended Hogwarts before working in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> with <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts Wizarding Bank</a>, and Hagrid encountered him numerous times when he moved back to <a href="/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>. Bill arrived with the Order of the Phoenix at Hogwarts during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">Battle of the Astronomy Tower</a>, where he was attacked by <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Fenrir Greyback</a>. Hagrid was invited to Bill's wedding to <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a>, in which <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a>, the youngest child and only daughter of the Weasley family, was a bridesmaid. Hagrid was quite fond of Ginny throughout her time at Hogwarts, and she was among the students who never even considered turning her back on Hagrid when she found out he was half-giant. Hagrid also knew she had a crush on <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, and playfully teased Harry about the fact in <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>.
</p><p>Hagrid did not appear to have much of a relationship with <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley" title="Percy Weasley">Percy Weasley</a>, though it is unlikely they would have been very close before the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, even if they had had more contact. Though neither Ron, Harry, nor Hermione were likely to inform Hagrid of this, Percy wrote to his younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, upon finding out that Ron had been made a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">prefect</a>, and advised him against associating with Hagrid, as he was a <a href="/wiki/Half-giant" title="Half-giant">half-giant</a>. He also tried to persuade Ron to support the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>, in favour of Dumbledore, to whom Hagrid was fiercely loyal. However, Percy abandoned the Ministry once it fell to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, apologised to his family, and fought against the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, after which Hagrid would have undoubtedly thought better of him.

<p>Hagrid had been a good friend of <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>'s parents, Lily and James, since the time they attended <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. Hagrid admired them for being amongst the best wizards and witches of their age. Hagrid became a member of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> around the same time as James and Lily, and they fought together throughout the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>.

</p><p>Hagrid knew them very well and conveyed the truth about them to their son, who had been lead to believe insulting lies about them and their deaths, restoring and preserving their legacy in their son. Hagrid also kept a leather-bound family album of them which he gave to Harry, which Hagrid came into possession of through unknown circumstances, but might have been entrusted to him by Lily and James to give to their son. Hagrid was known to respect them for their desire to fight for what was right.

<p>Though Hagrid described <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> as having been a "trouble-maker" in his youth, Hagrid had clearly been fond of him, as well as his best friend, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a>, when they were students at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. After graduating, Sirius, along with James, <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily Evans</a>, <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a>, joined the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> around the same time as Hagrid. 
</p><p>When James and Lily discovered they were <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a>'s next targets, they went into to hiding with the use of the <a href="/wiki/Fidelius_Charm" title="Fidelius Charm">Fidelius Charm</a>; Peter Pettigrew had been made their <a href="/wiki/Secret-Keeper" class="mw-redirect" title="Secret-Keeper">Secret-Keeper</a>, unbeknownst to anyone else, and betrayed the Potters to Voldemort, framing Sirius for the crime. For many years, everybody, including Hagrid, believed Sirius was the betrayer. The night James and Lily died, Hagrid met Sirius in <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a>, where Hagrid had been sent to rescue the infant <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> from the wreckage of the Potter's destroyed home, and Sirius lent Hagrid his <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black%27s_motorbike" class="mw-redirect" title="Sirius Black&#39;s motorbike">flying motorbike</a> to deliver Harry to <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>. By <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a>, Hagrid was horrified to think that he comforted the "murdering traitor" that very night and deeply resented him for his betrayal, raging that had he knew, he would have attacked Black in retaliation.

<p>Hagrid greatly respected <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a> professor and <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Gryffindor_House" title="Head of Gryffindor House">Head of Gryffindor House</a>. They attended Hogwarts around the same time (Hagrid having been expelled a few years before she started) and they later became members of the Hogwarts staff. As one of the most strict professors at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, McGonagall sometimes disapproved of Hagrid's lack of refined behaviour, especially during the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_ceremony" title="Sorting ceremony">Sorting ceremony</a>. However, they were close friends and fellow members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> in both wars.  
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a>, when <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> brought several <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a> officials to either have Hagrid forcibly removed from the school grounds, arrested, or both, McGonagall immediately came to Hagrid's defence; she took four simultaneous <a href="/wiki/Stunning_Spell" title="Stunning Spell">stunners</a> straight to her chest as she rushed to Hagrid's aid, and was incapacitated for some time at <a href="/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries" title="St Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries">St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries</a>. Hagrid was disgusted when McGonagall got stunned to the point that he attacked the Ministry officials who injured her in an uncontrollable rage, furiously denouncing them as cowards.  
</p><p>After <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s death, McGonagall stated that she appreciated Hagrid's opinion very much, as Dumbledore had, and took it into consideration when determining the best time to close the school. McGonagall later became Headmistress of <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, where Hagrid was still living by <a href="/wiki/2017" title="2017">2017</a>. Also, McGonagall showed no disdain when Hagrid drunkenly kissed her on the cheek at a Hogwarts Christmas celebration. On the contrary, she began to giggle and blushed. McGonagall was touched by Hagrid's defence of wanting to bury their mentor, Albus Dumbledore on Hogwarts's grounds, citing that no other Headmaster had given more to the school, and as such defended his stance on the matter.

<p>Hagrid always stoutly defended <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> against Harry's doubts and allegations, on the basis that <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> trusted Snape completely. When Snape killed Dumbledore, Hagrid initially disbelieved the fact and told Harry he must be mistaken but was later furious to learn that Snape had indeed killed the late Headmaster. Hagrid openly opposed Snape when he became the Headmaster of Hogwarts by holding a <a href="/wiki/Support_Harry_Potter_party" title="Support Harry Potter party">Support Harry Potter party</a> (unaware Snape was secretly still on their side), an act which almost resulted in his arrest and forced him to go into hiding until the final battle. Before Hagrid fled, Snape put students in detentions with Hagrid, ensuring that they were protected from the harsher and torturous punishments from the <a href="/wiki/Alecto_and_Amycus_Carrow" title="Alecto and Amycus Carrow">Carrows</a>. However, Hagrid eventually learned of Snape's true loyalties during the final confrontation of the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>.
</p><p>Hagrid and <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch">Argus Filch</a> regularly found themselves at odds; Filch thought that Hagrid was "an oaf," and even told <a href="/wiki/Mrs_Norris" title="Mrs Norris">Mrs Norris</a>, his cat, to keep an eye on the Gateskeeper. Filch did not seem to care or even really acknowledge when Hagrid became a professor, possibly because he was a <a href="/wiki/Half-giant" title="Half-giant">half-giant</a>, and Hagrid, for his part, called Filch a "sneakin' Squib", when the latter insulted him.

<p>Hagrid had been very familiar with Divination Professor <a href="/wiki/Firenze" title="Firenze">Firenze</a>, long before he began working at Hogwarts, and when the centaur's <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest_Centaur_colony" title="Forbidden Forest Centaur colony">herd</a> turned on him for entering into "the servitude of a human" by accepting the position at Hogwarts as a favour to Headmaster Dumbledore, it was Hagrid who saved him. Of all the centaurs Firenze seemed to be the most active in working against Lord Voldemort and was not above allowing <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> to ride on his back in the process of saving Harry's life — both of which elicited great respect and gratitude from both Harry and Hagrid.
</p><p>Hagrid also seemed to be on good terms with <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Potions_(class)" title="Potions (class)">Potions</a> <a href="/wiki/Potions_Master" title="Potions Master">master</a> in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>. It is possible that Slughorn was one of Hagrid's teachers at Hogwarts, but they later became co-workers. Slughorn attended <a href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>'s funeral and comforted Hagrid, and while this was mostly because he wanted to extract some of Aragog's valuable venom, Hagrid was touched nonetheless, and the two enjoyed a drunken salute to the late <a href="/wiki/Acromantula" title="Acromantula">Acromantula</a>.
</p><p>Hagrid initially held <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> in high regard, considering him a very talented and clever wizard, and initially seemed to have a good relationship with him, especially when he introduced Quirrell to Harry in the Leaky Cauldron. However, due to his loyalty to Voldemort, a disguised Quirrell later took advantage of Hagrid's love for magical creatures and manipulated a drunken Hagrid into revealing the secret of getting past Fluffy in exchange for a <a href="/wiki/Norberta" title="Norberta">dragon egg</a>. Hagrid was later horrified and guilt-ridden when he learnt of Quirrell's true nature after his death, calling him an "evil git" and blaming himself for Harry's injuries during his encounter with Quirrell and Voldemort. 
</p><p>Hagrid had a mixed relationship with <a href="/wiki/Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank" title="Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank">Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank</a> as while she worked as a substitute for Hagrid in Care for Magical Creatures and his gamekeeping duties when Hagrid was absent or had a mission to do, he slightly envied her teaching skills, which made other students (including Harry, Ron and Hermione) consider her a superior teacher to him for Care of Magical Creatures. This also made him accept Harry, Ron and Hermione's untrue claims of Grubby-Plank being a "terrible teacher" when they attempted to reassure him that they still cared for him despite not taking the subject for their sixth year. Grubbly-Plank on the other hand seemed to respect Hagrid for his skills and abilities despite the students considering her a better teacher than him, as she complimented Hagrid's training of the school's Thestrals and also kept silent about his mission to recruit the giants when Harry inquired her about his whereabouts, understanding the importance of his classified mission. 
</p><p>Hagrid disliked <a href="/wiki/Gilderoy_Lockhart" title="Gilderoy Lockhart">Gilderoy Lockhart</a>, as did the other teachers, due to his being an obnoxious and annoyingly incompetent teacher. Hagrid did not read any of Lockhart's books, rejected his ideas of Harry trying to hog the spotlight, and openly criticised him, something that he would not normally do to a teacher.

<p>The professor with whom Hagrid had the most difficult and antagonistic relationship was, by far, <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, who was a <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood_supremacy" title="Pure-blood supremacy">pure-blood supremacist</a> with a particular dislike for what she called "<a href="/wiki/Half-breed" title="Half-breed">half-breeds</a>." Throughout the <a href="/wiki/1995%E2%80%931996_school_year" title="1995–1996 school year">1995–1996 school year</a>, she made Hagrid's life miserable with her disruptive evaluations of his teaching (part of her role as <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_High_Inquisitor" title="Hogwarts High Inquisitor">Hogwarts High Inquisitor</a>, during which she was unabashedly condescending and critical.) 
</p><p>When <a href="/wiki/Lee_Jordan" title="Lee Jordan">a student</a> released two <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">nifflers</a> in her office, following Headmaster Dumbledore's departure from the school, she blamed Hagrid, although he had a rock solid alibi. She later brought <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a> officials to <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_cabin" class="mw-redirect" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s cabin">Hagrid's hut</a> in the middle of the night, either to arrest or forcibly remove him from the premises, though Hagrid was able to resist with the help of <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> and go on the run. 
</p><p>Hagrid was disgusted by Umbridge's and the officials attack on McGonagall, attacking the Ministry officials in retaliation, although he refrained from attacking Umbridge in order to escape from Hogwarts. Following the <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_in_the_Forbidden_Forest" title="Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest">Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest</a>, Umbridge was eventually suspended from Hogwarts in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a> and Hagrid was reinstated as a teacher.

<p>Apart from Harry, Ron and Hermione and the other Weasley children (excluding Percy), Hagrid seemed to have a good relationship with <a href="/wiki/Lee_Jordan" title="Lee Jordan">Lee Jordan</a> who was a friend of <a href="/wiki/Fred_and_George_Weasley" title="Fred and George Weasley">Fred and George Weasley</a> as he once shook Hagrid's hand, along with Fred and George, when he returned after his mission to find the giants. Apart from them, the other students had a mixed relationship with Hagrid which was especially evident while he taught <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a>. 
</p><p>Although many of the students had a relatively civil relationship with Hagrid outside his teaching, most of them considered Professor <a href="/wiki/Grubbly-Plank" class="mw-redirect" title="Grubbly-Plank">Grubbly-Plank</a> a more qualified teacher for the subject since Hagrid sometimes lost his confidence and preferred teaching dangerous creatures. The <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> students expressed the most enthusiasm when he assumed the post but after Draco Malfoy caused Buckbeak to attack him by insulting him and when Hagrid preferred teaching monstrous creatures over creatures which were tame, their enthusiasm on the subject reduced. Despite this, Hagrid arguably had the best relationship with the Gryffindor students as he was once a Gryffindor himself and was regularly seen supporting Gryffindor during Quiddich matches alongside the other Gryffindor students. <a href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a> believed that Hagrid was a poor teacher and said that <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a> students considered him a joke. It is unknown what relationship Hagrid had with the <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a> students, although it is possible their relationship was also mixed like the other students. However, while the other students mostly disapproved his teaching methods, Hagrid had an antagonistic relationship with the <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> students as they, encouraged by Draco Malfoy, were also prejudiced against Hagrid due to his status as a <a href="/wiki/Half-giant" title="Half-giant">half-giant</a>, and Draco's attack by Buckbeak, without caring that Draco did not listen to Hagrid in the first place.
</p><p>However, despite Hagrid's mixed relationship with them, most of the students with the exception of Slytherin opposed Dolores Umbridge alongside Hagrid and disapproved of Umbridge's harsh and critical treatment of Hagrid due to her prejudice against part-humans. They also believed that Hagrid had improved in his teaching by the time he was temporarily sacked by Umbridge although many of them did not take the subject for <a href="/wiki/Nastily_Exhausting_Wizarding_Test" title="Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test">N.E.W.Ts</a> due to their past experiences with the dangerous creatures he taught. They were also extremely angry when Hagrid was attacked by Umbridge, again excluding the Slytherin students. Hagrid also opposed the Death Eater's control of Hogwarts alongside many of the students, including holding a Support Harry Potter Party in his Hut, and also fought alongside them against Voldemort and the Death Eater's during the Battle of Hogwarts.

</p><p>Eventually, Hagrid found Harry and his family in <a href="/wiki/Hut-on-the-Rock" title="Hut-on-the-Rock">an old shack</a> out at sea (Vernon Dursley had become paranoid with the amount of Hogwarts letters arriving at their home, so he had temporarily vacated their home in the hopes that they would throw off any wizards possibly following them.) After giving Harry a birthday cake, he introduced himself to Harry, believing him to know everything about the wizarding world (from <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore%27s_letter_to_Petunia_Dursley" title="Albus Dumbledore&#39;s letter to Petunia Dursley">the letter left by Albus Dumbledore</a>.) Upon learning that Harry knew nothing, Hagrid became furious at the Dursleys for not telling him anything. 
</p><p>When Hagrid proceeded to tell Harry that he was a wizard, Vernon became angry and admitted that they had known for years and had been trying to "stomp it out of him", including admitting that they lied to Harry in telling him that his parents had really been killed in a car crash. This further enraged Hagrid, but Vernon continued to try and keep Harry from going to Hogwarts, going so far as to call Albus Dumbledore a "crackpot old fool". This, however, sent Hagrid over the edge; he lost his temper and used his pink <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_umbrella" class="mw-redirect" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s umbrella">umbrella</a> to give Dudley Dursley a pig's tail. This terrified Vernon and Petunia enough to let Hagrid take Harry. Eventually, they would remove the pig tail, but the encounter added a newfound fear of magic to the Dursleys' hatred of it. The incident scared Dudley so much that he instinctively grabbed his bottom when meeting the Weasleys, despite them being friendly wizards.

<p>Hagrid was disgusted by the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoy family</a>'s pure blood supremacist values, their open ill-treatment of <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-borns</a> and "<a href="/wiki/Blood_traitor" title="Blood traitor">blood traitors</a>," their allegiance to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> and their disrespect to <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>. In turn, the Malfoys disliked Hagrid, regularly mocking him and doing nearly everything in their collective power to get him sacked from his post at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, Hagrid broke up a fight between <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> in <a href="/wiki/Flourish_and_Blotts" title="Flourish and Blotts">Flourish and Blotts</a>, though Hagrid was quite understanding of what Arthur had felt the need to do. During the <a href="/wiki/1992%E2%80%931993_school_year" title="1992–1993 school year">1992–1993 school year</a>, Lucius was indirectly responsible for reopening of the Chamber of Secrets, as he had used the earlier scuffle with Arthur Weasley to slip <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_diary" class="mw-redirect" title="Tom Riddle&#39;s diary">Tom Riddle's diary</a> into <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>'s cauldron full of books. Hagrid was blamed for the attacks, just as he had been fifty years earlier when he was framed by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Riddle</a> for the Chamber's first opening. Hagrid was arrested as a precautionary measure by <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>, where Hagrid reacted angrily to Lucius' unnecessary presence and ordered him to get out his house. Lucius mocked Hagrid by wondering how his small hut could be considered a "house" and claimed he was only there to inform <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> that he and the other governors had voted on his suspension. Hagrid saw through Lucius and accused him of threatening the other governors, which later proved to have been exactly the case.

<p>Hagrid did not get along any better with Lucius’ son <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco</a>. Even before meeting Hagrid for the first time, Draco slandered him when talking to <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> for the first time, describing him as "...a sort of savage - lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed." Hagrid first met Draco in <a href="/wiki/1991" title="1991">1991</a> when he was sorted into Slytherin. During that year, Draco was put in detention with Harry Potter, <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>. Hagrid called Draco an "idiot" when he scared Neville, and in <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>, was outraged when he heard Draco called Hermione a Mudblood. Draco was in Hagrid’s <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a> class in <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a> and ignored Hagrid’s advice on how to handle Hagrid’s <a href="/wiki/Hippogriff" title="Hippogriff">hippogriff</a> <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a>. Draco insulted Buckbeak, causing the hippogriff to lash out and cut Draco’s arm. Hagrid took Draco to the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Wing" title="Hospital Wing">Hospital Wing</a>, but Draco swore revenge, and deliberately exaggerated his injury to get Hagrid into trouble. Lucius was furious when he found out and took legal action against Hagrid and Buckbeak. Hagrid tried hard to defend Buckbeak, but the court ruled in favour of Lucius, largely due to his influence at the Ministry, and Buckbeak was sentenced to death, though thanks to the efforts of Harry and Hermione, Buckbeak managed to escape. 
</p><p>In Draco's fourth year, he openly disobeyed Hagrid by saying that he would not be coming down to look after the blast-ended skrewts, saying that he spent too much time with them during regular class. Hagrid, hearing about the previous punishment 'Moody' gave Draco, threatened to turn him into a ferret. Later that year, Draco happily provided <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a> with skewed details about the events of the previous year and delighted when Hagrid temporarily went into hiding following Skeeter's publication of the article revealing that Hagrid was half-giant. In his fifth year, Draco spoke negatively regarding Hagrid during <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>'s inspection of a Care of Magical Creatures class conducted by <a href="/wiki/Wilhelmina_Grubbly-Plank" title="Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank">Professor Grubbly-Plank</a>, likely hoping that Hagrid would be placed on <a href="/wiki/Probation" title="Probation">probation</a> when and if he returned to Hogwarts, an outcome that did indeed come to pass.
</p><p>Given that Draco's wife Astoria helped to raise their son to be a kinder man than Draco was in his youth, it can be assumed that Scorpius Malfoy had a better relationship with Hagrid than his father did. This is also likely due to Scorpius being best friends with Albus Potter who was already a good friend of Hagrid's before his first year.

<ul><li>Rubeus, possibly from the Latin word "rubinus", means "red." According to Rowling herself, the first names of Albus Dumbledore and Rubeus Hagrid were chosen based on "the white" and "the red", which were considered essential mystical components of <a href="/wiki/Alchemy" title="Alchemy">alchemy</a>. Hagrid was given the red for passion or emotion, "an earthy, warm and physical man, lord of the forest".<sup id="cite_ref-pottermorecolours_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pottermorecolours-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Hagride is a verb that means "to torment".</li>
<li>Hagrid also may mean "hung over," as from <a href="/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a>.</li>
<li>A hag is a nightmare spirit in English folklore. According to folklore, the Hag sat on a sleeper's chest and sent nightmares to him or her.

<li>It is unknown why no one calls Hagrid 'Rubeus', which is his first name, although when Hagrid meets Harry for the first time he tells him to call him Hagrid as that's what everyone calls him.

<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Robbie_Coltrane" title="Robbie Coltrane">Robbie Coltrane</a> was J. K. Rowling's first and only choice for the role of Rubeus Hagrid. She did not, however, create the character with Robbie Coltrane in mind. He was instead, according to Coltrane, "based on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Angels" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Hell&#39;s Angels">Hell's Angel</a> she knew in the <a href="/wiki/West_Country" title="West Country">West Country</a>. ...he was just huge and terrifying. And then he would sit down and talk about his garden and how his petunias had been very bad that year."<sup id="cite_ref-pts29_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pts29-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> This is the reason why Coltrane is the only known actor to not speak in their native accent, instead speaking in a West Country accent, which is the only English accent noted for rolling of the 'r' sound, and often silencing 'h' sounds, which also became a stereotypical accent of pirates, because Robert Newton, who played the main character on Treasure Island, is actually from Devon in southwestern England.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>As well as being Rowling's first choice for the role of Hagrid, Coltrane was also the first person cast in the movie. Interestingly, Coltrane is one of the few actors to play a character <i>older</i> than themselves (Hagrid is in his 60s throughout the series, whilst Coltrane was 51 when he first played Hagrid and 61 the last time he did.)</li>
<li>American actor Robin Williams wanted the role of Hagrid and called director <a href="/wiki/Chris_Columbus" title="Chris Columbus">Chris Columbus</a> as well as casting director <a class="new" title="Janet Hirshenson (page does not exist)" rel="nofollow" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvSmFuZXRfSGlyc2hlbnNvbj9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE=">Janet Hirshenson</a> if he could get the part.<sup class="noprint">&#91;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs references to reliable sources." style="white-space: nowrap;">citation needed</span></i></a>&#93;</sup> However, the <i>"strictly British and Irish cast"</i> rule imposed by J.K. Rowling prevented him from getting the role, and Columbus with Hirshenson had to reject him out of respect for Rowling's wishes.</li>
<li>Robbie Coltrane returned to the part of Hagrid in 2014 and shot 3 different scenes for the official <i>Wizarding World of Harry Potter </i>website on which Hagrid welcomes the viewer in the Diagon Alley expansion.</li></ul></li></ul>

<li>Curiously, it says on Hagrid's Ministry card that he is 11.5 feet tall and weighs 289 pounds.

The only other known character to be below the range is <a href="/wiki/Porpentina_Goldstein" title="Porpentina Goldstein">Porpentina Goldstein</a> with a BMI of 17.8. The fact that Hagrid should be facing life-threatening symptoms from being all skin and bones is self-defeating: he is frequently described as huge and bulky in the books, and he is portrayed in the films by an obese actor (he weighed 280 pounds and was six feet tall).<sup id="cite_ref-LE_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LE-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> For Hagrid's weight to match his superhuman stature, he would like have to weigh in at over 1,000 pounds, as when you double an object's volume, you actually quadruple its weight to maintain structural integrity relative to the Earth's gravitational pull on its mass.</li></ul></li>

<li>Hagrid is a playable character in <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_1-4" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</a></i>. In the game, he can <a href="/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">fly</a> on a <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broomstick</a> in the game in spite of the fact that he claims in the books to be too large to ride broomsticks.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">&#91;38&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Fans of the series raised an immediate outcry upon learning that Hagrid never married. J.K. Rowling responded to the criticism by simply saying, "At least I didn't kill him."</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_1-4" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</a></i>, Hagrid is the first playable character, at the <a href="/wiki/Leaky_Cauldron" title="Leaky Cauldron">Leaky Cauldron</a> in <a href="/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a>. As Hagrid was expelled, he only has one spell on his Spell-Wheel, which is Wingardium Leviosa. However, after the player makes it to Hogwarts, he obtains his crossbow. Hagrid is unlocked in "The Forbidden Forest" level, by using Reducto on a silver chest in the third area.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(video_game)" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (video game)">video game adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i>, it was rumoured that Hagrid had an evil twin brother named <a href="/wiki/Dirgah_Hagrid" title="Dirgah Hagrid">Dirgah</a>.</li>
<li>In the credits of the film adaptation of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</a></i> and in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1_(video_game)" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game)">video game adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>, Hagrid is listed as "Hagrid the Giant".</li>
<li>In the extended version of 'JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe - A conversation', it is revealed that Rubeus is pronounced Roo-Bay-Us. It is unknown why JK Rowling did not ask for this to be the same in the films, somewhat like Voldemort, which in the books is pronounced with a silent T, except in the British Audible Renditions and American Audible Renditions of the last 3 books.</li>
<li>In the novel <i>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</i>, Hagrid was quoting "fool Gorgon" when he was about to sent a letter to Dumbledore regarding Harry at the first time he met him. Either Hagrid quoted that line as a mere cursing, or he knew that Gorgons (women-like creatures from Greek Mythology with living snakes as hair) existed in the magical world.</li></ul>
