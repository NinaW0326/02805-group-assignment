<b>Professor Patricia Rakepick</b> (born c. <a href="/wiki/1956" title="1956">1956</a>) was a <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark</a> <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">witch</a> and a world-famous <a href="/wiki/Curse-Breaker" title="Curse-Breaker">Curse-Breaker</a> for <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts Wizarding Bank</a>.
</p><p>Educated at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, during her formative years she was an exceptional student, top of her class, who, regardless, was always in trouble. After Patricia left school, her curse-breaking adventures abroad eventually earned her some publicity: her exploits were featured in several newspaper articles and at least <a href="/wiki/Book_about_Patricia_Rakepick" title="Book about Patricia Rakepick">one biography</a> was published.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Said to have had first-hand experience with the <a href="/wiki/Cursed_Vaults" title="Cursed Vaults">Cursed Vaults</a> during her student years, she was invited back to the school during the <a href="/wiki/1987%E2%80%931988_school_year" title="1987–1988 school year">1987–1988 school year</a> by Professor Dumbledore, the school's <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">Headmaster</a>, to help put an end to the threat posed by the Vaults.<sup id="cite_ref-y3ch10_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y3ch10-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> At the end of the year, she accepted his offer to assume the position of <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> instructor, where she offered more freedom and protection to <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> during their search for the remaining vaults.
</p><p>However, by the end of the next year, Rakepick's true intentions were revealed. She was working with the malevolent organisation known as <a href="/wiki/R" title="R">'R'</a>, and manipulated Jacob's sibling to open the <a href="/wiki/Buried_Vault" title="Buried Vault">Portrait Vault</a>, the last major obstacle before the final Cursed Vault. When Jacob's sibling and their friends discovered the truth, they managed to defeat Rakepick, forcing her to flee Hogwarts.

While Professor <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> found her to be an exceptional pupil,<sup id="cite_ref-y3ch10_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y3ch10-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> she was nevertheless greatly disliked by most of her professors for her rebellious streak, a sentiment that did not improve when she, rather than being a good role model to her younger peers as she grew older, began mentoring them in the art of trouble-making. According to <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>, during her student years, she was rumoured to be friendly with the <a href="/wiki/Marauders" title="Marauders">Marauders</a> (<a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, and <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a>), who Patricia to some extent mentored in mischief-making.<sup id="cite_ref-y4ch2_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y4ch2-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> Some of her teachers included <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Filius Flitwick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rolanda_Hooch" title="Rolanda Hooch">Rolanda Hooch</a>: the former was determined to keep an open mind about Rakepick, whereas the latter had a very low opinion of her.<sup id="cite_ref-y4ch2_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y4ch2-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>

Accepting this explanation, the professor explained that the easiest way for students to enter the forest undetected was by <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broom</a>, revealing secrets about the forest he had learned from numerous years spent exploring it himself.

<p>After leaving Hogwarts, Patricia Rakepick went on to work for <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts Wizarding Bank</a> as a <a href="/wiki/Curse-Breaker" title="Curse-Breaker">Curse-Breaker</a>, having apparently been taken in by the allure of a "<i>challenging career involving travel, adventure, and substantial, danger-related treasure bonuses</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> In the years that followed, she embarked on a number of daring expeditions to sites of historical sorcery, where she was in charge of breaking protective curses on old forgotten wizarding treasure and retrieving it. She had a <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Niffler</a>, called <a href="/wiki/Sickleworth" title="Sickleworth">Sickleworth</a>, assigned to aid her in burrowing for gold at cursed sites.
</p><p>Evidently a very efficient and gifted employee, her many curse-breaking adventures (involving a wide variety of dark and dangerous magical creatures, enchanted objects, and rivals alike) eventually won her both recognition and publicity. Over the years, a number of articles about her were published in the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">Daily Prophet</a></i>: among them one claiming that she had at one point killed a <a href="/wiki/Sphinx" title="Sphinx">Sphinx</a> with her bare hands, and another stating that she once allegedly ripped the tail off a <a href="/wiki/Manticore" title="Manticore">Manticore</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>According to <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, she made a career out of eliminating her competition,<sup id="cite_ref-y4ch12_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y4ch12-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> leaving many who knew her by reputation only with the impression that she was not to be crossed.
</p><p>At some point in her career, she met an <a href="/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">American</a> wizard who worked as an <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Magical_Congress_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Magical Congress of the United States of America">Magical Congress of the United States of America</a>, who advised her on the subject of constant vigilance and told her that there were "more than one way to skin a <a href="/wiki/Kneazle" title="Kneazle">Kneazle</a>", a sentiment she agreed with.<sup id="cite_ref-HM58_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM58-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In due course, Rakepick became the best Curse-Breaker at Gringotts, being promoted to the post of <a href="/wiki/Head_Curse-Breaker" title="Head Curse-Breaker">Head Curse-Breaker</a>, a role she held by at least in the mid-to-late-<a href="/wiki/1980s" title="1980s">1980s</a>.

<p>While Dumbledore assured his charges that the staff would do their utmost to keep them safe, he also explained that neither he, nor the faculty, had all the answers; stepping aside so Madam Rakepick could take his place behind the lectern, Rakepick thanked the Headmaster for such a warm welcome, commenting on her own age-old disregard for the school rules being part of her surprise at his invitation. After a short introduction of her own, mentioning both her work at Gringotts and how her suspicions about the Cursed Vaults went all the way back to her own education at Hogwarts, she proceeded to affirm her intentions of finding the Cursed Vaults and unveil the secrets within — and urged the students to be forthcoming whenever she might need their assistance, but also also strongly advised them against trying to get in any way involved without her prior permission.
</p><p>Charged with anything having to do with the Cursed Vaults, Madam Rakepick was notified when two students were placed in harm's way by wandering mindlessly into the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>, apparently while under the influence of a somnambulism of some sort. Recognising this as the same <a href="/wiki/Sleepwalking_curse" title="Sleepwalking curse">sleepwalking curse</a> that had been unleashed on the school years ago, she visited the victims at the <a href="/wiki/Hospital_Wing" title="Hospital Wing">Hospital Wing</a>: one was a young <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> boy whose injuries were so severe that he was in no condition to provide her with any useful information; the other was a <a href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a> girl named <a href="/wiki/Tulip_Karasu" title="Tulip Karasu">Tulip Karasu</a>. Karasu was being visited by the <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">ringleader</a> of a group of students that she knew was greatly involved in breaking the curses placed on the last two vaults that had been meddled with. Overhearing how they were discussing the vaults and the reason why the curse would make students walk into the Forbidden Forest of all places, a question with potentially dangerous implications, Madam Rakepick finally made her presence known to the two young conspirators.

<p>Intruding on their conversation, Madam Rakepick said she had been wondering the same thing since the last time the sleepwalking curse had sent students to their deaths via the dangerous beasts inside the forest. Confronted with her eavesdropping, however, she shifted the blame over to them by reminding them that, in no uncertain terms, the Cursed Vaults were no longer their concern. When Madam Rakepick learned the reason <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">the visiting student</a> wanted to find the Vaults was so they could find their brother <a href="/wiki/Jacob_(Hogwarts_student)" title="Jacob (Hogwarts student)">Jacob</a>, who had disappeared shortly after his expulsion for inadvertently endangering the school during his own search for the vaults, Rakepick changed her mind, suggesting they could help each other. Telling <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> that if they were to help her they should be aware of the dangers involved, Rakepick invited them to the <a href="/wiki/Training_Grounds" title="Training Grounds">Training Grounds</a> to learn a new spell that would allow them to properly defend themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-y4ch1_11-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y4ch1-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> Rakepick then left to find Miss Karasu's, as she wished to discuss the latter's sleep-walking incident with in private.

<p>Already there when Jacob's sibling arrived for their lesson, Madam Rakepick, who by then had been informed by the staff that the pupil before her was quite gifted, decided to try and solidify their potential alliance by appealing to their shared experience of embarking on curse-breaking adventures and the understanding of the dangers involved. Going as far as to proclaim them a curse-breaker on equal footing as herself, she went on to emphasise the importance of self-defence. She then trained Jacob's sibling in the use of the <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">Shield Charm</a>, justifying teaching them it prematurely by arguing that "curse-breakers like themselves" might very well not be alive to learn it another time:
</p><p>During the first part of the tutorial, Jacob's sibling practised casting the Shield Charm against <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_Death_Eater" title="Mechanical Death Eater">Death Eater dummies</a> while Rakepick observed and occasionally offered advice. After sensing that Jacob's sibling was capable enough, she decided to test them, dismissing their concerns that the <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">Blasting Curse</a> she wanted to use was potentially deadly; as a witch who lived for the thrill, she found that which was not deadly was very dull. Jacob's sibling was able to cast a fully-fledged Shield Charm in time, deflecting the curse. Congratulating them on their success, Rakepick noted that their professors were right to commend their talents, and ended the lesson by saying they were likely to meet again soon, before leaving the training grounds.<sup id="cite_ref-y4ch1_11-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y4ch1-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Shortly thereafter,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Rakepick was interrogating the school's <a href="/wiki/House-elves" class="mw-redirect" title="House-elves">house-elves</a> when <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Potions_Master" title="Potions Master">Potions Master</a> at Hogwarts, came to her, saying he had found another <a href="/wiki/Sleepwalking_curse" title="Sleepwalking curse">sleepwalking student</a>. He took her to see a <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> boy who was found in the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a>; the boy was standing upright, yet trapped in slumber. The examination of the pupil devolved into a petty spat rooted in lingering resentment from their own student years, with the <a href="/wiki/Head_of_Slytherin_House" title="Head of Slytherin House">Head of Slytherin House</a> accusing Rakepick of tampering with the Cursed Vaults, while she in turn mocked Snape's inability to let go of grudges. In the end, they agreed to put aside their personal animosity and work together to bring the student to the Hospital Wing.<sup id="cite_ref-y4ch1_11-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y4ch1-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>As the <a href="/wiki/1987%E2%80%931988_school_year" title="1987–1988 school year">1987–1988 school year</a> went on, the faculty continued to watch the perimeter of the Forbidden Forest in an effort to protect the students. Every so often, members of the staff such as <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Filius Flitwick</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> would find pupils wandering off to what would could very well have been their own death at the teeth and claws of the dangerous magical creatures lurking therein, had it not been for their timely intervention. As per Dumbledore's instruction, Madam Rakepick was kept well informed of these incidents and began to visit the Hospital Wing on a regular basis to see if there was anything more to be learned from sleepwalking victims who woke up. Rakepick also set up her own network of informants, including <a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a>, to keep her <i>au courant </i>about almost everything going on at Hogwarts. Around this time, she also looked into the possibility of a Cursed Vault in <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a>, which led her to make inquiries at <a href="/wiki/Three_Broomsticks_Inn" title="Three Broomsticks Inn">Three Broomsticks Inn</a>.
</p><p>At some point, Rakepick was informed that <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> had been asking the teachers about her, as well as researching the creatures of the Forbidden Forest. In return, Rakepick made inquiries into Jacob's sibling as well, questioning their classmates such as <a href="/wiki/Penny_Haywood" title="Penny Haywood">Penny Haywood</a>. Finally, Rakepick sent Jacob's sibling a letter arranging a meeting in the <a href="/wiki/Artefact_Room" title="Artefact Room">Artefact Room</a> for a private discussion. While not angry with them for snooping, she said that if they had questions about her, they could ask them to her face, as no one in the castle actually knew her as well as they thought they did. She also admitted that she considered them a standout from the student at Hogwarts, by virtue of their considerable talents and their reasons for wanting to find the vaults, and encouraged their pursuit of them. She also suggested they ask <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a> <a href="/wiki/Silvanus_Kettleburn" title="Silvanus Kettleburn">Silvanus Kettleburn</a> about how to enter the Dark Forest without being detected, since had spent a considerable amount of time exploring the forest and as such was privy to many of its secrets.

<p>With her search for the vaults hampered by the sleepwalking curse, Rakepick needed an assistant. She contacted all the students who met her criteria: above average in intelligence and ability, some sort of talent or expertise, and experience with the Cursed Vaults. She gathered her candidates at the training grounds to put them through a trial that would determine which of them would become her assistant. Six of her seven choices turned up, with only <a href="/wiki/Penny_Haywood" title="Penny Haywood">Penny</a> declining Rakepick's offer because she felt more like a potion-maker than a curse-breaker. When questioned by <a href="/wiki/Ismelda_Murk" title="Ismelda Murk">Ismelda Murk</a> as to why anyone would want to be her assistant, Madam Rakepick hinted that, she would be teaching her assistant powerful magic the likes of which they could not learn from any of their professors. She used the <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">Blasting Curse</a> on a <a href="/wiki/Mechanical_Death_Eater" title="Mechanical Death Eater">Mechanical Death Eaters</a> to illustrate her point.
</p><p>It did not take long before the chosen six were called to assemble at Training Grounds a second time. Rather than teaching them another curse, Rakepick said they were to <a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">duel</a> each other, and encouraged them to bypass the usual restrictions by using <a href="/wiki/Curse" title="Curse">Curses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charm" title="Charm">Charms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potion" title="Potion">Potions</a> and even physical violence if that was what they had to do in order to win, explaining that she expected them to from one another that evening. The last one standing would become her assistant. She let Jacob's sibling pick their opponent first, and after they had triumphed over their chosen adversary,<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> Rakepick ended the session, asking the victor to stay behind to see if they would be interested in a private lesson to teach them a spell she believed to "align with [your] <i>specific interest</i>". Before leaving the ground, she expressed her appreciation for their determination and thirst for knowledge and wished Jacob's sibling luck on their search for the Forbidden Forest.<sup id="cite_ref-y4ch4_9-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-y4ch4-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>

Patricia Rakepick was a haughty-looking witch with wavy red hair and blue eyes. Dressed for practicality yet with an obvious wizarding flair, she often wore a long-sleeved brown shirt and matching trousers decorated with a dragon scale texture, and a blood red waistcoat that was a shorter at the back than on the front. She wore black robes, on which an ornamental Eye of Horus was pinned, high boots and white gloves, as well as two light brown belts across her waist, one of which held a leather holster for her <a href="/wiki/Patricia_Rakepick%27s_wand" title="Patricia Rakepick&#39;s wand">wand</a>.

<p>While a self-declared daredevil with little regard for rules or restrictions and with a strong sense of entitlement, Patricia Rakepick was a highly intelligent and magically gifted witch, as evidenced by both her top performance at Hogwarts as well as her later achievements in life. Very secure in her own judgement and immensely confident in her own abilities, she would often eye those with whom she conversed with a look of gleeful smugness, yet could demonstrate a sudden temper or disdain towards those of whom she did not think very highly, such as <a href="/wiki/Ben_Copper" title="Ben Copper">Ben Copper</a>, whom she cruelly singled out during her evaluation of a group of students from which she wanted to pick an assistant for her sanctioned search for the Cursed Vaults. While she was sorted into Gryffindor upon arriving at Hogwarts, Severus Snape noted her to be unusually cunning for a member of that house.
</p><p>According to <a href="/wiki/Silvanus_Kettleburn" title="Silvanus Kettleburn">Silvanus Kettleburn</a>, she was a strict disciplinarian who did not suffer foolishness from anyone, be it from the Curse-Breakers working under her or domesticated magical creatures in her care. Her stringency in this regard was assumed to be the reason why <a href="/wiki/Sickleworth" title="Sickleworth">Sickleworth</a> was, according to Professor Kettleburn, the most well-behaved Niffler he had ever seen.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Known to take immense pride in her status as a world-renowned Curse-Breaker, she was not a particularly modest person, as seen by her shameless flaunting of her position of trust and prestige, even to her <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">peers</a>, in order to attempt to place herself above them. Not all talk and no bite, however, she was happy to be in the thick of the action, she is not someone to shy away from a dangerous situation, with even <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> believing her to be completely fearless. Patricia also had a devious streak, actively encouraging students to be ruthless in the manner they dealt their rivals by telling them to ignore the restrictions that their professors otherwise would have put on duels, and recruiting students to participate in searching for the Cursed Vaults in spite of Headmaster <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> expressively forbidding them in doing so.
</p><p>Beneath her veneer of cordiality, however, lurked a personality that was ambitious, cruel, sadistic and downright evil. Hungry for the power of the Cursed Vaults, Rakepick had no qualms with how she attempted to achieve this goal nor with whom she associated in the process, having joined the mysterious and intensely malevolent "R" and manipulating young and eager wizards and witches in this regard. She did not in fact care for her young charges in any way beyond their immediate or potential usefulness to her and willingly discarded them the moment she deemed them liabilities rather than assets.
</p><p>An intensely brutal and sadistic witch, Rakepick subjected her most loyal and trusting disciple, Merula Snyde, to repeated and prolonged torture with the Cruciatus Curse, which required a genuine willingness to inflict pain and enjoy doing so, also verbally taunting the poor girl for her misplaced faith. She later also tried to use the Killing Curse, which again requires a genuine willingness to kill and disregard for the life to be extinguished, on Ben Copper when he managed to actually hurt her during a duel. The only reason it didn't kill Ben was because of Rowan Khanna jumping in and pushing him away, taking the curse themselves and dying as a result, but Rakepick still showed herself as an intensely malevolent witch by not only being willing to murder young teenagers, but also to taunt Rowan's best friend with the reminder that "R" had intended to kill one of their friends.

<p>A highly accomplished <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">witch</a>, Patricia Rakepick was extremely talented, highly intelligent and rather powerful. Indeed, many held her abilities in such a high regard that many considered her to be the best <a href="/wiki/Curse-Breaker" title="Curse-Breaker">Curse-Breaker</a> in the world.
</p>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">Magical</a> mastery</b>: Undeniably of above average in intelligence and ability, even <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, arguably the greatest wizard of all time, openly respected her abilities. An exceptional pupil, she were one of the cleverest Hogwarts students of her time. In adulthood, she became a powerful Curse-Breaker for <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts Wizarding Bank</a> and rose to become, not only <a href="/wiki/Head_Curse-Breaker" title="Head Curse-Breaker">in charge</a> of such operations, but also widely believed to have been the greatest one alive. <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Keeper_of_Keys_and_Grounds" title="Keeper of Keys and Grounds">Keeper of Keys and Grounds</a> during her formative years and a member of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, considered her a dangerous witch whom he would rather have with him than against him, a claim fully backed up by <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, who attended Hogwarts around the same time and usually thought very little of members of Gryffindor House, yet acknowledged that she had built her career on "removing the competition" and made for a dangerous and formidable adversary indeed. Always on top of her class, she was known to have been very proficient in at least <a href="/wiki/Astronomy_(class)" title="Astronomy (class)">Astronomy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charms_(class)" title="Charms (class)">Charms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">Flying</a>, <a href="/wiki/Herbology" title="Herbology">Herbology</a>, <a href="/wiki/History_of_Magic" title="History of Magic">History of Magic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potions_(class)" title="Potions (class)">Potions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arithmancy" title="Arithmancy">Arithmancy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a>. In addition, despite their enmity, Severus Snape admitted, even if reluctantly, that out of all of the inhabitants of Hogwarts, the only one he knew for sure capable of stopping her would be <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> himself. Rakepick herself was unafraid of challenging Snape or <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">McGonagall</a>, both of whom were extremely powerful and skilled <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professors</a> of Hogwarts, with her even deeming herself fully capable of beating McGonagall had she chose to fight her when they argued. Her mere presence was enough for a group of dark wizards to abandon trying to fight Jacob's sibling and Merula. Even the highly arrogant <a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a> acknowledged Rakepick as definitely being far more skilled than both her and <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a>, with her stating that Jacob's sibling wouldn't stand a chance against the at the time Professor of DADA even if they had beaten all of their friends, which was proven by how Rakepick effortlessly defeated and destroyed their wand, previously making short work of <a href="/wiki/Ben_Copper" title="Ben Copper">Ben Copper</a> just after he had beaten them.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a></b>: Patricia Rakepick was known to have had a pronounced aptitude for the Defence Against the Dark Arts during her formative years, and her skill and proficiency only grew in the following years, during which she encountered (and expertly dealt with) a great many dangerous creatures, magical artefacts and curses throughout her career as a <a href="/wiki/Curse-Breaker" title="Curse-Breaker">Curse-Breaker</a>, which served as a further testament to her ability of fending off <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Magic</a>. In addition to an impressive academic record, she was also said to have spent as much time in the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> during her time as a pupil once she knew how to enter undetected, and her skill in the subject undoubtedly was of great help in keeping the dangerous creatures that dwelled therein at bay. As a matter of fact, Madam Rakepick's abilities in fending off the Dark Arts was sufficiently potent for <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> to eventually offer her the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a> of Hogwarts, during which, she effectively taught her students about dark creatures and defensive and offensive spell-work, much to their benefit, considering how little they had learnt with previous teachers. Her reputation on fighting the Dark Arts was such that her presence alone made a group of <a href="/wiki/Dark_wizard" class="mw-redirect" title="Dark wizard">dark wizards</a> wary, one of whom she easily subdued and they were not willing to challenge her.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Martial_magic" title="Martial magic">Martial magic</a></b>: An advocate for violence and unafraid of using it herself, Rakepick was a self-professed no hold barred fighter who did not believe in putting restrictions on <a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">duelling</a>, using <a href="/wiki/Curse" title="Curse">curses</a>, <a href="/wiki/Charm" title="Charm">charms</a>, <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">transfiguration</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potion" title="Potion">potions</a>, and even resorting to <a href="/wiki/Muggle_duelling" title="Muggle duelling">Muggle duelling</a> if that was what it took to overcome an adversary. According to <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, she had built her career on 'eliminating the competition', suggesting she had duelled and killed more than a few competitors, or at the very least injured them to the point of permanent incapacitation. After admitting to having had an argument with <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> that lead the then <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a> teacher to leave in anger, she made an off-hand comment to <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> about it had been "a wise decision on her part", suggesting Rakepick thought herself capable of defeating McGonagall if things had "gotten out of hand". She also was confident that she would have no trouble defeating <a href="/wiki/Rosmerta" title="Rosmerta">Rosmerta</a> when she challenged Rakepick to kill her, although she backed away because Rosmerta had the advantage of several <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a> on her side. Snape acknowledged that the only one who could for sure defeat her should she prove to be malicious would be <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a>. Rakepick later easily subdued <a href="/wiki/Ben_Copper" title="Ben Copper">Ben Copper</a> just as he was about to kill <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> with a single powerful <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">Blasting Curse</a> that sent him flying across half the <a href="/wiki/Clock_Tower_Courtyard" title="Clock Tower Courtyard">Clocktower Courtyard</a> and straight into a wall, knocking him unconscious. As <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a>, Rakepick also effectively instructed her students on martial magic, at one point in order to discipline Jacob's sibling, she instantly overtook them before they could even cast a spell, destroying their wand.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a></b>: As a <a href="/wiki/Curse-Breaker" title="Curse-Breaker">Curse-Breaker</a>, Rakepick had a high level of knowledge on <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Magic</a> and how to break its hold on places that might house gold and riches that <a href="/wiki/Gringotts_Wizarding_Bank" title="Gringotts Wizarding Bank">Gringotts Wizarding Bank</a> might want in their vaults, and was capable of identifying various dark creatures and artefacts with ease. While not famed for practising it herself, her understanding of its potency was such that, while testing a group of students to determine which of them would become her assistant in her search for the cursed vaults, professed that the <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">Blasting Curse</a>, a spell of potentially lethal effect if used against another living being, had served her well in dealing with enchanted objects, creatures and rivals and later encouraged them to follow her example by including curses in their repertoire for combative magic. She was also sure of her ability to dispatch of the six students she had called upon to test while looking for an assistant for her search for the <a href="/wiki/Cursed_Vaults" title="Cursed Vaults">Cursed Vaults</a>, if she had so desired.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> By her own admission, she had never believed in putting restrictions on duelling, encouraging the aforementioned group of students to be vicious in combat and openly disapproved of Jacob's sibling's lack of brutality in their spell-casting while duelling, despite emerging victorious. She also taught spells she herself claimed to be potentially deadly to the students at the school to use in duels, indicating she had the skills, knowledge, willingness and malicious intent required to successfully cast spells of an even darker variety. She at one point even threatened to murder <a href="/wiki/Rosmerta" title="Rosmerta">Madam Rosmerta</a>, the landlady of the <a href="/wiki/Three_Broomsticks_Inn" title="Three Broomsticks Inn">Three Broomsticks Inn</a> in the village of <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> when she stood in her way during Rakepick's search for information about the Cursed Vaults, only backing down because Rosmerta informed her two of the customers present that day also happened to be <a href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Aurors</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-HM618_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM618-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Her <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">Blasting Curse</a> was powerful enough to send him flying across the edge of the <a href="/wiki/Clock_Tower_Courtyard" title="Clock Tower Courtyard">Clocktower Courtyard</a> and straight into a wall, instantly knocking him out. She also performed dark spells herself during her time teaching DADA to test the strength of the protective enchantments of Jacob's sibling and at one point effectively instructed her students how to use the <a href="/wiki/Impediment_Jinx" title="Impediment Jinx">Impediment Jinx</a>. In order to teach Jacob's sibling a lesson, Rakepick cast a curse that destroyed their wand instantly but left them unharmed. She was also proficient in the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a>, easily breaking a <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark Wizard</a> she practised it on while stating she was holding back and claiming she could make Jacob's sibling see torture beyond their imagination had she used full capability. She also sadistically tortured <a href="/wiki/Merula_Snyde" title="Merula Snyde">Merula Snyde</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Buried_Vault" title="Buried Vault">Portrait Vault</a> in an attempt to kill her, subjecting her to agonising pain, resulting in her being hospitalised as a result of her injuries. Along with that, she was also revealed to have cursed her dark artefacts to prevent them from being tampered with Dark Magic that was so rare that even <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> was unable to lift them, with Dumbledore being the only one adept enough in defensive skills out of the professors to successfully neutralise the curses to study them. Her willingness and skill in utilising extremely dangerous and even lethal dark magic on her enemies, ironically showed herself to be a very powerful and malevolent <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">Dark witch</a>, despite having spent much of her career fiercely opposing the dark arts and all its practitioners, however using it ruthlessly and callously to achieve her own sinister goals. Rakepick was capable of casting the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Killing Curse</a>, which she used to ruthlessly murder <a href="/wiki/Rowan_Khanna" title="Rowan Khanna">Rowan Khanna</a> with, showing the true extent of her abilities in this field.<sup id="cite_ref-HM618_4-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HM618-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Transfiguration" title="Transfiguration">Transfiguration</a></b>: <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, the school's Headmaster and former Head of the <a href="/wiki/Transfiguration_department" title="Transfiguration department">Transfiguration department</a>, remembered her as having been an exceptional student back when he was still teaching. She also encouraged students at Hogwarts to use transfiguration in duels, suggesting she had the ability to effectively incorporate transfiguration spells in her martial magic. When she taught <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">one of the students</a> how to <a href="/wiki/Spider_repelling_spell" title="Spider repelling spell">repel spiders</a>, she quickly <a href="/wiki/Spider-conjuring_spell" title="Spider-conjuring spell">conjured</a> a spider for the student to practise on. In addition, she also instructed her team of hand-picked students how to cast <a href="/wiki/Incarcerous_Spell" title="Incarcerous Spell">Incarcerous Spell</a>. Given how <a href="/wiki/Conjuration" title="Conjuration">Conjuration</a> is one of the most difficult and advanced branches of transfiguration, her proficiency in <a href="/wiki/Conjuring_Spells" title="Conjuring Spells">Conjuring Spells</a> clearly demonstrated her very impressive talents in this field. She was also proficient in <a href="/wiki/Vanishment" title="Vanishment">Vanishment</a>, as she was able to teach her fifth year DADA students how to cast the <a href="/wiki/Snake-Vanishing_Spell" title="Snake-Vanishing Spell">Snake-Vanishing Spell</a> effectively.</li></ul>

This was fully backed up by her teacher in the subject, <a href="/wiki/Silvanus_Kettleburn" title="Silvanus Kettleburn">Silvanus Kettleburn</a>, who remembered her as his most gifted student during her time at Hogwarts.

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">Flying</a></b>: Madam Rakepick was a very proficient flyer, particularly in her youth, as she often sneaked into the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> during her formative years as a student at Hogwarts, which she accomplished by <a href="/wiki/Broomstick" title="Broomstick">broom</a>. Notoriously massive and treacherous, it required a high level of control to not only be able to fly into/through it, but also to land safely. When <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> learned how Madam Rakepick had managed to enter the forest, the individual in question resolved to do the same, but had to improve their abilities as a flyer to do so safely despite being among the most talented flyers in their year, which highlighted Madam Rakepick's skill on a broom.</li>
<li><b><a href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a></b>: Patricia was a highly skilled Occlumens, enough so to repel the masterful <a href="/wiki/Legilimency" title="Legilimency">Legilimency</a> abilities possessed by Severus Snape and even Snape had to begrudgingly acknowledge her skills in the art.

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Muggle_duelling" title="Muggle duelling">Physical combat</a> skills</b>: Madam Rakepick was known to encourage the infusion of physical combat into one's duelling style, stating she has never believed in putting restrictions on duelling, which implies that she either had done so in the past or at the very least was willing to if she deemed it necessary to overcome an adversary. She also once allegedly killed a <a href="/wiki/Manticore" title="Manticore">Manticore</a> with her bare hands and supposedly ripped the tail off a <a href="/wiki/Chimaera" title="Chimaera">Chimaera</a>, both of which would, if true, be truly remarkable feats of physical prowess indeed.</li>
<li><b>Intellectual giftedness</b>: Noted by <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> as "cunning for a <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>", who acknowledged that she was "no fool", Madam Rakepick shown to be very sharp-witted and perspicacious. In addition to always being on top of her class at the school, which would have required a certain theoretical aptitude in addition to her natural ability, she was also clever enough to go toe-to-toe with her former peer on an intellectual level when she was enlisted by <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, and easily saw through Snape's attempt at using <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> to spy on her, and had already according to Snape himself turned some of his own <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> students against him by spying on him for her, although he was unaware who.

<p>Five years his senior at Hogwarts, Severus Snape met Patricia Rakepick for the first time while they were both still students, and took an immediate dislike to her: Bold as brass and with little regards for school rules, and a member of <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor House</a> to boot, Patricia Rakepick was someone whom Severus would one day compare to his arch-rival during his schooldays, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a>, another trouble-making Gryffindor. Whilst it is uncertain what he thought of Rakepick's initial claims about the existence of the fabled Cursed Vaults as a student, he did acknowledge that she was remarkably ambitious for a Gryffindor, and by no means stupid. By the time he had replaced <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> as the school's <a href="/wiki/Potions_Master" title="Potions Master">Potions Master</a>, Rakepick was already a notable curse-breaker and building her career on eliminating her competition. Wary of her true intentions, when Albus Dumbledore invited her back to help break the curses plaging the school and its denizens, their old rivalry immediately reignited, and Snape immediately went about trying to uncover whatever ulterior motives she might have, suspecting that she wanted to use the vaults to take control of Hogwarts.
</p><p>From that moment on, it is known that Snape and Rakepick were engaging in a subtle battle of wits, and even used students to spy on one another. Recognising that Rakepick regarded <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">one of the pupils</a> as a potential rival in her quest to find the vaults, and aware how Rakepick dealt with rivals, Snape cleverly had said student serving as his spy to shift her attention over on him to protect the student as a supposed mastermind of the youngster's actions, while also using the ploy as a tool to try and learn what Rakepick was up to and expose her to Dumbledore, the one person who they knew for a certainty would be able to put a stop to her plot, whatever it might be.

<p>Patricia Rakepick had mixed relationships with the faculty at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. While academically gifted, most of the professors, including both those who taught her in the past and old schoolmates who had joined the staff since she graduated, disliked and distrusted her ever since her formative years as a student for her rebellious nature and frequent rule-breaking.
</p><p>While there were some exceptions, such as Albus Dumbledore, who was her Transfiguration teacher prior to his appointment as Headmaster of Hogwarts sometime before her fifth year, who never said an ill word about her and merely stated his belief that she was an excellent student, and <a href="/wiki/Silvanus_Kettleburn" title="Silvanus Kettleburn">Silvanus Kettleburn</a>, who remembered her as his best student and even confided in her secrets about the <a href="/wiki/Forbidden_Forest" title="Forbidden Forest">Forbidden Forest</a> and the best way in which to enter in undiscovered, (though he came to suspect she had ulterior motives eventually), most teachers did not think very highly of her. Among these teachers were <a href="/wiki/Rolanda_Hooch" title="Rolanda Hooch">Rolanda Hooch</a>, whose contempt of Rakepick was such that she outright refused to voice her honest opinion on her in front of her pupils, and <a href="/wiki/Pomona_Sprout" title="Pomona Sprout">Pomona Sprout</a> warned <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">one of her students</a> that Rakepick might be more even dangerous than she appeared at first glance. <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick" title="Filius Flitwick">Filius Flitwick</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Charms_Master" title="Charms Master">Charms Master</a>, preferred for people to make up their own minds about Rakepick, rather than base their own opinion upon his own, and did not comment on it to students.

<p>Presumably well aware of the events that lead to the <a href="/wiki/Discipline_at_Hogwarts#Expulsion" title="Discipline at Hogwarts">expulsion</a> of former Hogwarts student <a href="/wiki/Jacob_(Hogwarts_student)" title="Jacob (Hogwarts student)">Jacob</a> long before she ever met his younger sibling, given her own interest in the vaults, Rakepick took interest in the latter individual for their first-hand experience with the Cursed Vaults, and is known to have kept an eye on them, possibly even before she was invited back to Hogwarts by the Headmaster of the day, Albus Dumbledore, to help put the threat of the Cursed Vaults to rest. Though she did not waste any time soliciting the help of said student and their group of friends to make her own, sanctioned search for the vaults easier, and even assured Jacob's sibling she meant them no harm and even were investigating the identity of the <a href="/wiki/R%27s_messenger" class="mw-redirect" title="R&#39;s messenger">mysterious wizard</a> that had attacked them in the <a href="/wiki/Clock_Tower_Courtyard" title="Clock Tower Courtyard">Clock Tower Courtyard</a> after curfew by forging a letter with the handwriting of Silvanus Kettleburn. Severus Snape, however, the Potions Master and former schoolmate of Rakepick's, did not trust her at all, going so far as to saying she had ulterior motives for being at Hogwarts and that she was after the Cursed Vaults for her own gain, and quite possibly meant to kill both them and anyone else who stood in her way. Rakepick continued, however, to request the assistance of Jacob's sibling, teaching them the <a href="/wiki/Shield_Charm" title="Shield Charm">Shield Charm</a> to test their abilities and, getting impressive results, continued to offer guidance, such as lending them <a href="/wiki/Sickleworth" title="Sickleworth">her own</a> <a href="/wiki/Niffler" title="Niffler">Niffler</a> to help in the search for clues and eventually teaching them the <a href="/wiki/Spider_repelling_spell" title="Spider repelling spell">Spider repelling spell</a> in order to prepare them for a potential fight with Acromantulas. 
</p><p>In the end, however, Snape's suspicions were proven partially correct when she fooled Jacob's sibling into breaking into the <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch%27s_office" class="mw-redirect" title="Argus Filch&#39;s office">office</a> of <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch">Argus Filch</a> for a wild goose chase, only to swoop in and retrieve something she herself had been looking for. This eventually left Jacob's sibling uncertain if Rakepick can be trusted or if they are playing right into the hand of their potential enemy. Rakepick did redeem herself for her indiscretions, however, when she saved the life of Jacob's sibling by coming to their rescue just as their attacker was about to deliver the <i>coup de grace</i>, casting a <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">Blasting Curse</a> so powerful that the attacker was blasted backwards, across almost the whole length of the <a href="/wiki/Clock_Tower_Courtyard" title="Clock Tower Courtyard">Clocktower Courtyard</a> and into a wall, knocking them out cold. Upon undoing the <a href="/wiki/Disillusionment_Charm" title="Disillusionment Charm">Disillusionment Charm</a> the attacker was under, they discovered that the person in question was <a href="/wiki/Ben_Copper" title="Ben Copper">Ben Copper</a>, whom Rakepick transported back into the castle to prevent him from hurting himself or others while Jacob's sibling went after the Forest Vault.

<p>The name "Patricia" is a common female given name of Latin origin, and is derived from the Latin word "patrician", meaning "noble", and is the feminine form of the masculine given name Patrick.
</p><p>The name "Rakepick" is apparently derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_picking#Rake_picks" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lock picking">a type of lock-pick</a>, maybe to highlight her being someone who goes to one place to obtain gold to bring back to her employers.
