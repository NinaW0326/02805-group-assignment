<p>Pettigrew went into hiding as a rat, hoping to avoid <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>'s other supporters. As Voldemort had met his downfall on Peter's information, the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> suspected him of being a traitor; he feared that if they learned of his continued existence, the ones who escaped incarceration (such as <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Corban_Yaxley" title="Corban Yaxley">Corban Yaxley</a>) would kill him for leaving their organisation in such a chaotic state. Looking for a wizarding family to take him in, he came into the possession of <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley" title="Percy Weasley">Percy Weasley</a> and, later, Percy's youngest brother <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>. He was taken good care of while living with the Weasleys and was named "Scabbers". 
</p><p>As Scabbers, Pettigrew returned to Hogwarts with Percy Weasley when he began his education in the <a href="/wiki/1987%E2%80%931988_school_year" title="1987–1988 school year">1987–1988 school year</a>. <a href="/wiki/Jacob%27s_sibling" title="Jacob&#39;s sibling">Jacob's sibling</a> met him and Percy immediately after the <a href="/wiki/Start-of-Term_Feast" title="Start-of-Term Feast">Start-of-Term Feast</a> the following year while helping <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">William Weasley</a> study for his <a href="/wiki/Nastily_Exhausting_Wizarding_Test" title="Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test">Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests</a>. During this time, Percy seemed to be the only one to think positively of the rat.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>

<p>It was clear Scabbers was an extraordinary rat; he was unusually old for a rat; they have an average life expectancy of two to three years, yet the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley family</a> owned him for twelve. The reason he chose to be adopted by a wizard family was that he could keep track of the news in the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a> and could rejoin his master should he return to power. Positioned as he was, he could also bring <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> as a welcome-back gift, so no Death Eater would dare claim him a traitor, but he never took action during his time as Ron's pet, because Voldemort was not strong enough to protect him. Despite once biting <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Goyle" title="Gregory Goyle">Gregory Goyle</a> on the knuckle when he attempted to steal Harry and Ron's food, Ron generally thought that Scabbers was useless, since all Scabbers did was 'eat and sleep.'

He had been agitated by the news of Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban, afraid that he would find him and finally avenge the Potters. Eventually, Pettigrew faked his death yet again, by biting himself and leaving blood, allowing Ron to believe that Crookshanks had eaten the rat. This incident almost ruined Ron and Hermione's friendship until they reconciled over helping Rubeus Hagrid appeal his defence of Buckbeak the hippogriff. Hermione later discovered Pettigrew hiding in a milk jug in <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_cabin" class="mw-redirect" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s cabin">Hagrid's cabin</a>.

Each of them was disgusted by his cowardice, and his daring to ask them for mercy after deceiving them in so many ways infuriated them even more.

<p>Remus and Sirius planned to kill their old friend, but Harry intervened after Pettigrew claimed that Harry's father would have never killed him. This, along with Harry's own belief that his father would not want his best friends to become killers, led him to be merciful.

<p>Pettigrew was an extremely short man (no taller than Harry when he was thirteen or Hermione when she was fourteen years old) with grubby skin, small watery eyes, and a pointed nose, all of which were lingering attributes of his animagus rat form; he even spoke in a squeaky voice that is another lingering attribute of his rat form. In his youth, his hair was mousy brown, but by his mid-thirties, it had thinned, lost a lot of its colour, and acquired a large bald patch.
</p><p>The stress he endured also apparently caused him to appear middle-aged by his mid-thirties. He was also described as "fat" in his youth, but when forced to return to his human form in the <a href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a>, he looked as though he lost plenty of weight in a short time, mostly due to his stress of fearing Sirius' wrath. In <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a>, he cut off his right index finger as part of a ploy to fake his own death, which is reflected in his "Scabbers" form, and, fourteen years later, he cut off his entire right hand at the request of Lord Voldemort. Voldemort used magic to give Pettigrew a shining silver, glove-like replacement. As a Death Eater, he bore the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> on his left inner forearm.

<p>Peter Pettigrew was characterised by weakness. Despite having been <a href="/wiki/Sorting_ceremony" title="Sorting ceremony">Sorted</a> into <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, he did not possess true bravery, possibly proving that the Hat saw potential in him rather than any actual inborn courage, potential that he never lived up to. The <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a> may have mistaken his adoration of James and Sirius for steadfastness, or sensed in him a desire to surround himself with respected individuals and believed that he would make a compatible friend to a Gryffindor; Pettigrew clearly looked up to strong, courageous people and it is possible that the Sorting Hat put him there because he wished to absorb that quality. It is also likely that Pettigrew requested the Sorting Hat to place him in <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, with his friends, just as Harry Potter would later request not to be placed in Slytherin. Indeed, he underwent a <a href="/wiki/Hatstall" title="Hatstall">Hatstall</a> when being sorted, being considered between <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, though the hat ultimately decided that it made the right choice to this day, citing the manner in which Pettigrew died as (what some would call dubious) evidence.<sup id="cite_ref-PMdh_13-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PMdh-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In his youth, he latched onto James Potter and Sirius Black, more talented and popular students, idolising them and living vicariously through their accomplishments, as well as joining them in bullying other students, such as Severus Snape, whom he would not have been likely to cross without James and Sirius to back him up. Due to the huge difference in terms of talent, bravery, and popularity, Peter was more of a hanger-on than an equal. However, the three Marauders did love Peter as a friend and brother, which made the eventual betrayal of James especially bitter.
</p><p>Pettigrew defected from the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> and betrayed his closest friends to Lord Voldemort when his life was threatened, showing selfishness and disloyalty at the core of his being.<sup id="cite_ref-PoA_12-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PoA-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Even Voldemort viewed him with disdain; the only reason why he kept him alive was because he occasionally proved to be useful.<sup id="cite_ref-GoF_20-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GoF-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> When Voldemort fell, Peter neither attempted to find him nor tried to murder Harry under <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>'s watchful eye, until he was sure Voldemort would be revived to protect him. When cornered by Sirius and Remus, Peter shamelessly begged for mercy, despite having used and betrayed them. But if there was one thing that he feared more than death, it was most likely the <a href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor&#39;s Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a>; the thought of being left to the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a>' mercy would've terrified anyone.

<p>Pettigrew was an opportunist, who allied with the side that seemed strongest and appeared to be winning — thus becoming "friends" with James and Sirius in school, and then leading him to become a <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eater</a> when the opportunity arose. He was loyal only to himself and acted in whatever his best interest was at the moment. He expected that he would be rewarded for leading Voldemort to <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, and later had the same expectations with <a href="/wiki/Bertha_Jorkins" title="Bertha Jorkins">Bertha Jorkins</a>, assuming Voldemort would reward him for capturing a <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> employee, despite not knowing the extent of her usefulness. He only returned to a broken down Voldemort simply because he had no other choice, as the other side was aiming to kill him, and would have gone to anywhere else if he had more options, seeing Voldemort at the time was too weakened to be the victorious side, along with the task of caring for his lord being tedious and unpleasant.
</p><p>In spite of others claiming that Pettigrew was a "<i>weak, talentless thing</i>", he was at least cunning enough to escape his former friend <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius</a> after Voldemort's first defeat, frame him for his crimes, and fake his own death while killing twelve people with one curse, living for years in his <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a> form. He originally formulated his plan to return to the Dark Lord without being accused a traitor by his colleague Death Eaters: to turn Harry in as a welcome back present and be honoured above all others; though a well thought out plan and he waited patiently, it was upset when Pettigrew's form was exposed prematurely. He also managed to manipulate <a href="/wiki/Bertha_Jorkins" title="Bertha Jorkins">Bertha Jorkins</a> to accompany him with ease, when he brought her to Lord Voldemort. He was also adept in the Dark Arts, powerful enough and malicious enough to use the Killing Curse on Cedric Diggory. In moments of desperation Pettigrew was willing to amputate his own limbs to serve his purposes, such as his finger to fake his death, and his hand to revive Voldemort, the latter being promised with a worthy reward. He was, however, foolish enough to stop by an inn for food en route to returning to Voldemort, which led him to run into a Ministry employee; if Pettigrew had not been cunning enough to persuade Bertha into his trap, he might have exposed his own duplicity to the world at large then, as Voldemort had noted.

<p>However, despite his treacherous and cowardly nature, Pettigrew did feel some regret for betraying his friends, and he hesitated to kill Harry when reminded of his <a href="/wiki/Life_debt" title="Life debt">life debt</a>, in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>. Though he quickly tried to undo the moment of weakness, his "tiny merciful impulse" resulted in his being strangled to death by his own <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew%27s_silver_hand" title="Peter Pettigrew&#39;s silver hand">silver hand</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Pettigrew also suggested that Voldemort should find another enemy to use for his rebirth, though when Voldemort began to suspect that he cared about <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter" class="extiw" title="en:Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, Pettigrew hastily claimed that Harry meant nothing to him. This suggested that he may have consciously felt some gratitude towards Harry for sparing his life.<sup id="cite_ref-GoF_20-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GoF-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> Pettigrew also realised and admitted that he was a coward saying that he'd never been brave like Sirius, Remus, and James. Though he valued his own life more than the lives of his friends, Pettigrew felt guilt for betraying Lily and James, but did not have the courage to admit his treachery until it was forced out of him, or to turn against Voldemort. He did feel rather under-appreciated when Voldemort claimed him to be an unintelligent and disloyal servant when comparing to <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">Barty Crouch Jnr</a>. and also seemed resentful that he was treated as little more than a servant for Snape, though he refrained from complaining too much when Snape threatened to request more dangerous assignments for Peter. Without James, Sirius, and Remus protecting him, Peter found no courage to go against Snape, who would in turn bully him in return throughout their time as Death Eater colleagues.
</p><p>During his time as Scabbers the rat, under the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley family</a>'s care, Pettigrew was lazy and unmotivated, as all he did was sleep and eat, and only on one occasion did, he bit Goyle's knuckle on his owner's behalf. This could be because Pettigrew enjoyed being pampered and waited hand and foot, believing that as a pet rat he did not have to do much and can relax instead, at least until Sirius' escape from <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> prompted him into action. Even after returning to his Death Eater services, he continued to show certain levels of laziness and carelessness that leads to mistakes, such as foolishly stopping at an inn for food while on his way to Albania that led him to meeting with a <a href="/wiki/Bertha_Jorkins" title="Bertha Jorkins">Ministry employee and former schoolmate</a>, or neglecting his duties of guarding <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">Barty Crouch Snr</a> that allowed him to escape.
</p><p>Pettigrew was one of only two known Death Eaters who dared referred to Voldemort by name,<sup id="cite_ref-PoA19_5-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PoA19-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-GOFF_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOFF-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> the second being Barty Crouch Jnr.<sup id="cite_ref-GoF_20-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GoF-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-GOFF_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOFF-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup> However, Pettigrew still flinched when Sirius said the name during their reunion in the Shrieking Shack.

In <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a>, he was able to cast a potent <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">Blasting Curse</a> that blew up a street and put a 40-foot crater in the ground with his wand behind his back, killing twelve <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggles</a> simultaneously; the explosion was so powerful that all the sewers hundreds of feet deep were completely destroyed.

<li><b><a href="/wiki/Duelling" title="Duelling">Duelling</a></b>: According to <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Professor McGonagall</a>, Peter had always been "hopeless at duelling" during his years at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>.

He also suggested that Voldemort allow him to leave and capture a suitable wizard or witch for the body regeneration potion, showing that he was confident enough in his abilities to overpower an average opponent at least.

<p>During his seven years at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>, Peter came to greatly admire <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> for their popularity and magical ability, as well as James' renowned skills as  <a href="/wiki/Chaser" title="Chaser">Chaser</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor_Quidditch_team" title="Gryffindor Quidditch team">Gryffindor Quidditch team</a>. Though they accepted him as a friend and included him in their various mischief-making endeavours, it was clear he was considered more of a hanger-on than an equal. Nevertheless, they were close throughout their time at school. When they discovered that a member of their group, <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, was a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a>, they illegally became <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagi</a> so as to be able to accompany Remus while he was in his transformed state, rather than shun him as many would have. The four of them eventually came to be known as the "Marauders". While James, Sirius, and Remus considered Peter a true friend and would have willingly died for him, Peter proved that he lacked any similar conviction or sense of loyalty.

<p>When <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> first started gaining power, Peter immediately defected from the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> and joined the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> out of fear for his own life.

Peter later framed Sirius for the crime by pretending to confront him, then cutting off his own finger before taking his rat Animagus form; he killed twelve <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggles</a> in the process, and landed Sirius in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for twelve years. Sirius had convinced James to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper in what he believed to be a brilliant gambit. This was proven to be a fatal mistake that Sirius would regret for the rest of his life.

Remus, unaware of the truth until twelve years later, thought Peter died in a heroic confrontation with Sirius.
</p><p>When Peter's treachery was revealed to James' son, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, both Sirius and Remus showed no mercy nor sympathy for Peter's lack of courage (if anything, both were disgusted by him), and were absolutely intent on killing Peter, and were only stopped by Harry's insistence that Pettigrew was not worth their becoming murderers. As Remus had forgotten to take his <a href="/wiki/Wolfsbane_Potion" title="Wolfsbane Potion">Wolfsbane Potion</a> in the wake of discovering Pettigrew's continued existence, he transformed under the full moon and was completely uncontrollable. Peter was able to escape, but for his freedom he owed Harry a <a href="/wiki/Life_debt" title="Life debt">life debt</a> that would later cost him his own life. Peter's escape led Sirius to remain a wanted fugitive for another two years and only Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a>, Dumbledore and, later, members of the second <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> to know of his innocence for those two final years.

<p>While they were students at Hogwarts, Pettigrew, along with <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, enjoyed tormenting Severus Snape. Pettigrew, who probably would not have fared well duelling with a wizard as skilled and powerful as Snape, only got away with doing so because he had more talented friends backing him up.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP28_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP28-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> For this reason, Snape possibly viewed Pettigrew with even more scorn than the other three because of his pitiful ineptitude. Or perhaps his intense dislike of Pettigrew was due to the former betraying <a href="/wiki/Lily" title="Lily">Lily</a>, the woman he loved to Voldemort. It is possible that Snape regarded Pettigrew as being too negligible of a person to be worthy of hating, as he showed very little care for Pettigrew during their time in <a href="/wiki/Spinner%27s_End" title="Spinner&#39;s End">Spinner's End</a>, aside from maintaining a sense of superiority over Pettigrew in every chance possible and making him even remotely useful around the house.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP2_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP2-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When the Dark Lord later assigned Pettigrew to work as his assistant, Snape took to treating him like a slave, forcing him to clean his house and serve food to his guests, while refusing to let him in on their meetings. Pettigrew, though very dissatisfied with Snape's abuse, found little courage to argue or request the Dark Lord for reassignment, and seemingly had to obey out of fear of Snape, as he flinched as though Snape threw something at him when ordered to serve <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix</a> and <a href="/wiki/Narcissa_Malfoy" title="Narcissa Malfoy">Narcissa</a> wine. With the feeble protests Pettigrew made proved his ineptitude and cowardice, Snape openly and contemptuously mocked him for it, showed his "assistant" no respect whatsoever, and regarded the treacherous coward as a negligible vermin.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP2_21-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP2-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Peter first met Lily Evans during the <a href="/wiki/Sorting_ceremony" title="Sorting ceremony">Sorting ceremony</a> at Hogwarts, during which they were both Sorted into Gryffindor. Peter regularly took part in bullying her then-best friend <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, and as such, he did not make any better an impression on her than James or Sirius did. After Lily ended her friendship with Snape, she eventually married <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a>. She seemed to be much closer to James' circle of friends by that time, especially when they all joined the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>. She even affectionately referred to Peter as "<i>Wormy</i>," from his nickname "Wormtail," and noted that he "seemed down" on the week before <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_first_birthday" title="Harry Potter&#39;s first birthday">Harry Potter's first birthday</a>, as she tells in a letter to <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>. She would not have known that it was because he was enlisted in the Death Eaters and playing spy. Peter, out of fear of his own life, and what Sirius described as "<i>finest moment of [his] miserable life</i>", betrayed Lily's location to Voldemort without a moment of hesitation.

<p>Harry Potter initially believed Peter Pettigrew had been courageous for challenging the alleged traitor, <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, despite appearing so comparatively timid and weak; Harry even compared him to his own friend <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>. As Scabbers, Harry felt that Hermione should at least feel responsible when <a href="/wiki/Crookshanks" title="Crookshanks">Crookshanks</a> allegedly ate him, when in truth Peter faked his death a second time. Though he was disgusted by Pettigrew's disloyalty and cowardice when he learned the truth, he could not stand to see his father's two best friends become murderers, and requested that they leave Pettigrew to face the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> instead. Pettigrew managed to escape, leaving Harry unable to prove his godfather, <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>'s innocence. However, because of Harry's intervention to save Pettigrew, the latter owed Harry a <a href="/wiki/Life_debt" title="Life debt">life debt</a>. Harry, on the other hand, felt regretful for sparing Pettigrew's life and did not want such a bond.

<p>Originally Peter spared no thought on betraying Harry and his family to Voldemort, and even prepared to turn Harry in the moment he catches wind of the Death Eaters regaining momentum as a welcome-back present. However, perhaps due to this debt, Pettigrew consciously felt gratitude towards the boy, as he suggested that Voldemort should use another wizard's <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Regeneration_potion" title="Regeneration potion">rebirth ceremony</a>, and hastily implying that Harry meant nothing to him when Voldemort raised the issue, an act that seems to be denial rather than honesty. Of course, Voldemort also saw this as an attempt for Wormtail to desert him once more, out of sheer regret of ever returning. A year later, Pettigrew met Harry again in the <a href="/wiki/Little_Hangleton_graveyard" title="Little Hangleton graveyard">Little Hangleton graveyard</a>, where Pettigrew bound Harry to <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle Snr</a>'s grave and then cut Harry's arm to use his blood in a <a href="/wiki/Regeneration_potion" title="Regeneration potion">potion</a> that would restore Voldemort to his former glory. Throughout this meeting, Wormtail struck Harry for struggling, but did not make eye contact when returning Harry <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter%27s_wand" title="Harry Potter&#39;s wand">his wand</a>, per Voldemort's orders. Pettigrew's life debt was finally repaid during the <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_at_Malfoy_Manor" title="Skirmish at Malfoy Manor">Skirmish at Malfoy Manor</a>, when his momentary hesitation to strangle Harry was interpreted as a sign of weakness by the silver hand he received from Voldemort, and it turned on him. Though both Harry and <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a> attempted to stop it, Peter Pettigrew was strangled to death by his own hand.

<p>After framing <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> for the crimes of betraying <a href="/wiki/James_and_Lily_Potter" title="James and Lily Potter">James and Lily Potter</a> and murdering twelve Muggles, Pettigrew went into hiding in his <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a> form, and disguised himself as a rat named Scabbers. He came into the possession of <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley" title="Percy Weasley">Percy Weasley</a>, who eventually handed him down to his younger brother <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>. Thus, Petrigrew had been in the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley family</a> for twelve years, which was in Sirius' perspective a "<i>curiously long life for a common garden rat.</i>" Despite Ron's frequent complaints of Scabbers having been a rather boring, useless pet, he felt a strong sense of ownership and was at times very fond of him; especially when Scabbers bit <a href="/wiki/Gregory_Goyle" title="Gregory Goyle">Gregory Goyle</a>'s knuckle. However, Hermione's cat immediately recognised the rat for who he was and constantly attempted to catch him; this misunderstanding furthered Ron's protective nature over Scabbers. When Scabbers faked his own death by leaving bloodstains on the sheets, Ron assumed that he was eaten by the cat. Ron and Hermione got into such a row over the incident that they almost ended their friendship. Ron later discovered him in <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid%27s_cabin" class="mw-redirect" title="Rubeus Hagrid&#39;s cabin">Rubeus Hagrid's cabin</a> and was overjoyed, though Scabbers continued to attempt to flee, struggling against Ron's efforts to pocket him and even biting him on the finger, much to Ron's confusion and irritation. When Sirius finally managed to corner the rat, Ron absolutely refused to believe what Sirius and <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a> were telling him until he saw with his own eyes that Scabbers was the traitorous Peter Pettigrew. Ron took this as a personal insult and was too disgusted to respond to Pettigrew's pleas, and even savagely volunteered to act as an anchor alongside Lupin to prevent Pettigrew from escaping. 
</p><p>Four years later, when Pettigrew was being strangled by his own <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew%27s_silver_hand" title="Peter Pettigrew&#39;s silver hand">silver hand</a>, Ron tried to save him with a <a href="/wiki/Revulsion_Jinx" title="Revulsion Jinx">Revulsion Jinx</a>, and failed.

<p>Hermione Granger first met Pettigrew in disguise as Ron's pet rat named "Scabbers" in 1991. In 1993, she and Ron nearly ended their relationship, as Ron was convinced that <a href="/wiki/Crookshanks" title="Crookshanks">Crookshanks</a>, her cat, had eaten Scabbers. However, they all learned the truth later, when Peter Pettigrew was exposed by <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> and <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>; "Scabbers" was Peter Pettigrew, the wizard who betrayed <a href="/wiki/James_and_Lily_Potter" title="James and Lily Potter">James and Lily Potter</a> to Lord Voldemort. Peter was afraid of Sirius and Remus, and knew that they wanted to kill him in order to avenge James and Lily. Pettigrew appealed in turn to Hermione, who was horrified and shocked by the entire discovery. 
</p><p>The last time Pettigrew saw Hermione was in 1998, during the <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_at_Malfoy_Manor" title="Skirmish at Malfoy Manor">Skirmish at Malfoy Manor</a>. Hermione was being tortured by <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>, while Pettigrew was sent to check on the prisoners downstairs. Pettigrew attempted to strangle Harry, but momentarily slackened his grip when Harry reminded him of his life debt, and was killed for it by the <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew%27s_silver_hand" title="Peter Pettigrew&#39;s silver hand">silver hand</a> made for him by Voldemort. Hermione learned about his death after the battle.

<p>When Lord Voldemort first began gaining power during the <a href="/wiki/First_Wizarding_War" title="First Wizarding War">First Wizarding War</a>, Pettigrew switched sides and began secretly serving the Death Eaters. Though he gave valuable information, such as the whereabouts of Lily, James,<sup id="cite_ref-PoA19_5-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PoA19-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> and was granted the Dark Mark that only the inner circle had, Voldemort still showed little respect for Pettigrew's cowardice and disloyalty.<sup id="cite_ref-GoF_20-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GoF-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When Voldemort met his first downfall, Pettigrew did not try to find his master, but instead hid in his Animagus form as <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ronald Weasley</a>'s pet rat, "Scabbers". Pettigrew turned his back on Voldemort for being too much of a wreck to protect him, and did not attempt to murder Harry Potter due to that. He only intended to return if Voldemort would regain his strength, in which Pettigrew would present Harry as a "welcome back present" in order to make it appear that he never betrayed the Dark Lord. When <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> escaped from <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> and Pettigrew's duplicity was uncovered, he had no choice but to flee and seek Voldemort's protection from Black. Though he regretted this decision, and attempted several times to escape, while flinching and shuddering at any contact with Voldemort's rudimentary body, he ultimately engineered Voldemort's return to physical form, and Voldemort rewarded Pettigrew with a new <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew%27s_silver_hand" title="Peter Pettigrew&#39;s silver hand">silver hand</a> for having sacrificed his own. Voldemort also forced <a href="/wiki/Garrick_Ollivander" title="Garrick Ollivander">Garrick Ollivander</a> to create a new wand for Pettigrew, a favour which the once highly revered <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> did not even receive after his wand was destroyed.<sup id="cite_ref-GoF_20-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GoF-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> 
</p><p>Voldemort neither trusted nor respected Pettigrew. He knew that Pettigrew felt no true allegiance to him and kept him only because he was sometimes useful (often times without Pettigrew being the wiser),<sup id="cite_ref-GoF_20-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GoF-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> or having him assigned to menial tasks.<sup id="cite_ref-DH1_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH1-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> He also made it clear just how little he trusted Pettigrew, when he designed the silver hand he made to turn on the man for any attempts at treachery; it did just that when it strangled Pettigrew for hesitating to kill Harry Potter in 1998.<sup id="cite_ref-DH23_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH23-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup> Based on this, it is possible that Voldemort reacted to Pettigrew's death with indifference at worst, especially since Voldemort had by that point been more concerned with the <a href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a>.

<p>The Death Eaters held Pettigrew in contempt because it was based on his information that Voldemort met his first downfall at <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a>. The ones who were imprisoned at Azkaban screamed in their sleep that Pettigrew was a traitor, and according to <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, if any of the Death Eaters who had evaded imprisonment had gotten wind that Pettigrew was still alive, they would have tried to kill him. It was for this reason, as much as his fear of retribution from the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> when Black revealed that Pettigrew had been the Potters' Secret Keeper, that he disguised himself as "Scabbers" for twelve years after framing Black for his crimes. To prevent them from killing him when he would return to Voldemort, Pettigrew had originally planned to bring in Harry Potter to them as a welcome back present to his lord, in order to prevent anyone from saying that he betrayed Lord Voldemort.
</p><p>When Pettigrew returned to the service of the Dark Lord, he was assigned to serve his colleagues, such as <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoy family</a>, as a lowly household servant. Both treated him with disdain, much as Voldemort himself did, and insultingly referred to him as "Wormtail." It can also be noted that while he was present at the Death Eaters' meeting at Malfoy Manor, he did not sit at the table amongst them, since Voldemort assigned him to deal with a <a href="/wiki/Garrick_Ollivander" title="Garrick Ollivander">prisoner</a> in the dungeons. Pettigrew appeared to respect the Death Eater <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> and her sister <a href="/wiki/Narcissa_Malfoy" title="Narcissa Malfoy">Narcissa Malfoy</a>, as he seemed very happy to see them at Snape's house in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, although he might simply have been attempting to flatter them or win their sympathy. Their feelings toward Peter are unknown, though Bellatrix may have at least appreciated his role in reviving their master, or otherwise resented him for taking so long to do so. Regardless, the sisters took Snape's suggestion of neglecting Pettigrew and went on with their confidential meeting.
</p><p>During the preparations to bring Voldemort back to full power, Pettigrew worked with <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">Bartemius Crouch Junior</a> to subdue <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>. Crouch, despite his hatred for disloyal Death Eaters, was able to set aside his differences with Pettigrew to work together.

<p>Albus Dumbledore's relationship with Peter when the latter attended Hogwarts is unknown.

<ul><li>In the Bible, Peter is the name of one of Christ's apostles who, on the morning of the crucifixion, denied Christ, although he later repented. Also, the name "Pettigrew" could be derived from the French word "petit" ("small") and the English word "grew," hence "grew small." The name "Pettigrew" could also be a reference to his time as Ron's rat, being the pet that Ron grew. "Petti" could also be a corrupted form of 'petty' meaning "of little importance" or "trivial", showing his lack of talent and - had he not befriended James, Sirius or Remus - easily overlooked.</li>
<li>Scabbers may derive from the word "scab." A scab is the crusty covering blood forms over a wound as it clots. A scab is also a worker hired to replace others who are on strike, and "Scabby the Rat", often used as a caricature by the labour rights movement, is a possible source for his name.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> "Scab" is also slang for a horrible person, which could reflect Peter Pettigrew's true nature.</li>

<ul><li>Peter Pettigrew is the only known Death Eater from Hogwarts that was not from <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin House</a>, as <a href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a> is believed to have attended <a href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> (Ravenclaw) was never officially a Death Eater.</li>
<li>There is no appearance or mention at all of Pettigrew's father: It is unknown if he is a wizard or a Muggle, and unknown if he died or had abandoned his wife and son before the Potters' deaths.</li>
<li>Almost like Harry, Peter underwent a <a href="/wiki/Hatstall" title="Hatstall">Hatstall</a> when being sorted, being considered between Gryffindor and Slytherin by the hat before being put in Gryffindor.<sup class="noprint">&#91;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Wikipedia:Citing sources"><i><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag needs references to reliable sources." style="white-space: nowrap;">citation needed</span></i></a>&#93;</sup></li>
<li>As a contemporary of <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily Evans</a>, Peter was also taught <a href="/wiki/Potions_(class)" title="Potions (class)">Potions</a> by <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a>.</li>
<li>Peter is the only <a href="/wiki/Marauders" title="Marauders">Marauder</a> who does not have:
<ul><li>Any family connection to <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">Ted Lupin</a>. Teddy is the son of <a href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>. Teddy's godfather is <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, the son of <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a>. Teddy's <a href="/wiki/Andromeda_Tonks" title="Andromeda Tonks">grandmother</a> was a first cousin of <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>.</li>
<li>A first name that ends with the letter 's': Remu<u>s</u>, Siriu<u>s</u>, and Jame<u>s</u>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Despite his weak character, Pettigrew does seem to have a high pain tolerance, as he cut off his finger in order to fake his death, and years later severed his entire hand for the rebirth of Voldemort.</li>
<li>Sirius Black and Remus Lupin said that Wormtail "needed all the help that he could get" while describing how he, Sirius, and James became Animagi.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup> However, he was able to perform the <a href="/wiki/Killing_Curse" title="Killing Curse">Avada Kedavra</a> curse,<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> which the <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">fake Moody</a> said takes a powerful bit of magic. In addition, the <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">curse</a> he used to kill the <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew%27s_victims" class="mw-redirect" title="Peter Pettigrew&#39;s victims">Muggles</a> caused an explosion that "made a crater so deep that it cracked the sewer below."
<ul><li>It is possible that Pettigrew's magical aptitude improved as he aged, since the latter two examples were done when Pettigrew was adult.</li>
<li>It is likelier, however, that because of his cowardice he triggered powerful magic out of sheer desperation.</li>
<li>A third possibility is that he was always a skilled wizard, but his timid personality overshadowed this to others.</li></ul></li>
<li>If Peter was born in 1960 (rather than late 1959, which would still put him in the same school year as as Remus, Severus, Sirius, James, and Lily), his Chinese Zodiac symbol is a Rat. Interestingly, Rats are often known to be good and loyal friends. Peter is the opposite, considering how he betrayed James and Lily.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> was revealed to be eating <a href="/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a> for nourishment during the 1994-1995 school year while in hiding.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Sirius was also feeding <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a> rats during his stay at <a href="/wiki/12_Grimmauld_Place" title="12 Grimmauld Place">12 Grimmauld Place</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> Whether this had anything to do with Sirius' contempt for Pettigrew or was just a coincidence is unknown.</li>
<li>Peter Pettigrew is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">British</a> actor <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Spall" title="Timothy Spall">Timothy Spall</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)" title="Harry Potter (film series)">film adaptations</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)">Goblet of Fire</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">Half-Blood Prince</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>.
<ul><li>Peter is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Hughes" title="Charles Hughes">Charles Hughes</a> as a teenager in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">fifth film</a>.</li>
<li>Peter also appears in the first three films, as Scabbers the rat, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Dex" title="Dex">Dex</a>.
<ul><li>Since he also appears in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">eighth film</a> (in a flashback from the third film,) he is one of the fourteen to appear in every film adaptation.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>His film portrayal makes him appear much older than his canonical age of 33 or 34 years. It is possible that living as a rat took a toll on his health and made him appear older than he really was. However, he looks only slightly younger in the picture of the original order, the only real difference being the browner hair. It is quite common for characters to look older in the films (Snape, James, Sirius.)</li>
<li>Pettigrew is also portrayed as being slightly more sinister, less cowardly and somewhat sadistic in the films: in <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i>, after immediately being disarmed by Harry, he gives a cruel smile and sarcastically waves goodbye before transforming for his escape; in <i>Goblet of Fire</i>, he smiles ominously at <a href="/wiki/Frank_Bryce" title="Frank Bryce">Frank Bryce</a> (presumably with intent of attacking him) as Voldemort orders him to step aside and let the Dark Lord finish off the unfortunate Muggle caretaker.</li>
<li>In the books, Peter seems to be left-handed, since he cut his finger on the right hand. But in films he is shown to be right-handed, because it is shown that he cut his finger on the left hand.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, Pettigrew has been referred to by his name, "Peter" and "Pettigrew" by characters and the narration. However, subsequent novels, until the final novel refer him almost exclusively as "Wormtail", the only Marauder to have been called in such fashion; J.K. Rowling has yet to explain her reasons behind this.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, Dumbledore tells Harry that "there may well come a time when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew's life." This is confirmed in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, where he strangles himself instead of Harry.</li>
<li>Wormtail appears in all seven Harry Potter books, although his appearance in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i> is in the Pensieve rather than in person, and he only appears in his Animagus form in the first two books.</li>
<li>In an earlier draft of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i>, Peter taught <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> and possibly impersonated <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a> instead of <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">Barty Crouch Jnr</a> This could mean that Wormtail would be the one to suffer the Dementor's Kiss, although this would be less likely since it seems that the Dementor's Kiss is reserved for escaped Azkaban prisoners - which Peter was not.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">&#91;30&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, Harry notices that Peter is missing an index finger, while in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">film adaptation</a> he is missing a ring finger. Despite this, he still cuts off his right hand in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a></i>.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, there is a Transfiguration class in which the students transform animals into water goblets. Ron tries to turn Scabbers into a goblet, however, as his wand is broken, Scabbers turns into a goblet with fur and a tail.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, after Pettigrew is revealed, he is shown adopting several rat-like traits, such as fidgeting in place and sniffing repeatedly. Whether this was an extension of his cowardly behaviour or a side effect of his forcibly reverting back to a human after spending a long period as a rat is unclear.</li>
<li>Pettigrew has no lines in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>, and appears for less than ten seconds.</li>
<li>In <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>, Pettigrew is the only Death Eater present at Malfoy Manor when Harry, Ron and Hermione are captured, who did not witness Griphook's torture or Dobby's rescue.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">first film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>, Pettigrew is not killed by his hand. Of course, just because he did not die the same way as in the books does not mean that he necessarily survived. He wasn't anywhere in the last movie. If he did survive, chances are he ended up in Azkaban. He is stunned and knocked unconscious by <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Skirmish_at_Malfoy_Manor" title="Skirmish at Malfoy Manor">Skirmish at Malfoy Manor</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i> and is not mentioned in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Part 2</a></i> aside from the flashbacks from the earlier films. His absence suggests that Voldemort killed him upon arrival at Malfoy Manor, or at the beginning of <i>Part 2</i> after the Gringotts scene, considering that Peter was the warden of the cellar used as a prison at the time. This is apparently because the manner of his death was deemed to be too disturbing for a PG-13 rated film.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>A plush version of Scabbers is available at <a href="/wiki/The_Wizarding_World_of_Harry_Potter" title="The Wizarding World of Harry Potter">The Wizarding World of Harry Potter</a>.</li>
<li>In a bonus level on <i><a href="/wiki/LEGO_Harry_Potter:_Years_1-4" title="LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4">LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4</a></i>, Peter is shown to willingly give directions to the Potters' residence, whereas in the books and the film he is told as to give directions out of cowardice.</li>
<li>J. K. Rowling has said that no Death Eater except <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> could conjure a <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a>. However, she also said that members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> used their Patronuses to communicate. It is unknown if Peter could cast the spell. Given Pettigrew's extreme cowardice and lacklustre aptitude for magic, it is highly unlikely that he could master it. Although it should be noted that he managed to conjure a very effective killing curse that killed Cedric, so while not probable, it is not an impossible theory.</li>
<li>Peter Pettigrew's life debt to Harry can be based on the life debt in <i>The Lion and Mouse</i>, Harry being a true Gryffindor whose emblem is the lion and Peter being able to turn into a rodent.</li>
<li>Wormtail is comparable to <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue" class="extiw" title="w:c:lotr:Gríma Wormtongue">Gríma Wormtongue</a> from <a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" class="extiw" title="w:c:LOTR:J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <i><a href="https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" class="extiw" title="w:c:LOTR:The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a></i>; Wormtail's nickname is similar to Wormtongue's surname, and both are referred to most often by these names by others. Both are also notable as grovelling, cowardly servants to harsh, cruel and unforgiving masters who treat them with disdain and abhorrence. Indeed, Wormtail served Lord Voldemort in much the same way Wormtongue served <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saruman_the_White" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Saruman the White">Saruman the White</a>. Also, the deaths of both are changed/partially omitted in the film. Wormtongue was killed by Hobbits at the end of the book <i>Return of the King</i>, while he is killed by Legolas at the beginning of the film in a scene only shown in the extended edition.</li>
<li>Harry's attitude toward Pettigrew is comparable to Bilbo Baggins' response to Gollum. Each protagonist spared the life of an antagonist who seemed to have deserved death. And, in both cases, a wizard affirmed the choice, noting that the pity that was shown would have some effect on the way the story would unfold.</li>
<li>In the <i><a href="https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Wormtail" class="extiw" title="w:c:redwall:Wormtail">Redwall</a></i> books, there is a very minor character that is named Wormtail as well. This Wormtail is a rat and is reported in the book to have lost a finger, the same as Peter Pettigrew.</li>
<li>It was predicted by many fans that Pettigrew would kill Remus Lupin with his silver hand, as Remus is a werewolf. However, J. K. Rowling subsequently mentioned in an interview that, contrary to what is seen in films, in her view werewolves are not affected by silver. However the Marauder that dies by the silver hand is not Lupin, but Wormtail himself.</li>
<li>Many fans predicted that Wormtail would have some part to play in the destruction of Voldemort (because of his life debt), such as telling Harry how to destroy the Horcrux inside him without dying himself. This turned out to be wrong.</li>
<li>Pierre Pettigrew was a former politician and Minister of Foreign Affairs.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup> Note that "Pierre" is the French form of "Peter".</li>
<li>In the films, contrary to the books (in which a finger from his right hand was cut off), a finger from his left hand was cut off in order to fake his death. Him cutting off his left ring finger is, in a way, almost similar to the Assassins from the <i>Assassin's Creed</i> game series (particular Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad) would amputate their left ring fingers to operate a hidden blade.</li>
<li>The most fitting <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses" title="Hogwarts Houses">Hogwarts Houses</a> for Peter Pettigrew may have been Slytherin, seeing as he was driven only by self-preservation (his "cunning" and "loyalty" being learned only through fear of death). There are many kinds of Slytherins, one of them being those who do everything only for themselves. While Pettigrew would seem to be one of this ilk, he may have been best suited in <a href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff House</a>, as those who do not fit in any House (which is to say those who show too many or too few traits of the other Houses, Pettigrew being the latter) are meant to be sorted there. The <a href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a> seemingly Housed Pettigrew in <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> due to his adoration of <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_(disambiguation)" title="James Potter (disambiguation)">James</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius</a> and perhaps potential of being stalwart, but he would have been more accepted in Hufflepuff, and thus far less likely to have gone down the road he did.  Still, Peter was hiding at Hogwarts, in Harry Potter's bedroom, right under Dumbledors nose for many years, showing both nerve and daring; two qualities of Gryffindor.</li></ul>
