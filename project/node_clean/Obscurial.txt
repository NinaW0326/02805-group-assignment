<p>When a magical child is forced to repress their talent through physical or psychological abuse, they develop a parasitical magical force inside of them called Obscurus, resulting from their strong emotions of distress.<sup id="cite_ref-FBS_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FBS-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>An Obscurial may lose control when they reach their emotional and mental breaking point, releasing their Obscurus as an invisible (or nearly invisible) destructive wind. In extreme cases, they may physically transform into an Obscurus.<sup id="cite_ref-FBS_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FBS-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>When an Obscurial releases the Obscurus within, their eyes become pure white and their physical form vibrates and becomes distorted. While the Obscurus is invisible, the Obscurial can physically interact with the world without making physical contact, though the ability is uncontrolled and triggered by the host's distress, anger, or other intense emotions. This notably damages structures and objects near the host.<sup id="cite_ref-FBS_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FBS-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Usually, children possessed by an Obscurus almost always die before their tenth birthdays, but as exemplified by <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a>, a wizard or witch with tremendous latent powers can survive longer. When the child dies, the Obscurus vanishes along with them, though <a href="/wiki/Newton_Scamander" title="Newton Scamander">Newt Scamander</a> successfully kept one alive when its host died by encasing it in a magical bubble. It seems that Obscurials can't be killed in Obscurus form; the Obscurus may be shattered temporarily, but the Obscurial themself will still be alive if Credence is anything to go by. However, he is only one example and is stated to be unusually powerful.<sup id="cite_ref-FBS_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FBS-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<ul><li>Many have wondered why <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> did not develop an <a href="/wiki/Obscurus" title="Obscurus">Obscurus</a>, or become an Obscurial. On her official website F.A.Q., author <a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> answered: <i>"An Obscurus is developed under very specific conditions: trauma associated with the use of magic, internalised hatred of one’s own magic and a conscious attempt to suppress it. The Dursleys were too frightened of magic ever to acknowledge its existence to Harry. While Vernon and Petunia had a confused hope that if they were nasty enough to Harry his strange abilities might somehow evaporate, they never taught him to be ashamed or afraid of magic. Even when he was scolded for ‘making things happen’, he didn’t make any attempt to suppress his true nature, nor did he ever imagine that he had the power to do so."</i><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<ul><li>While still unconfirmed, <a href="/wiki/Ariana_Dumbledore" title="Ariana Dumbledore">Ariana Dumbledore</a> was potentially an Obscurial too, as the description of her "illness" given by her brother <a href="/wiki/Aberforth_Dumbledore" title="Aberforth Dumbledore">Aberforth</a> fit the description of an Obscurial; <i>"It destroyed her, what they did: she was never right again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned her inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and harmless"</i>. It would also explain how, as an untrained witch, she was capable of killing her mother in an uncontrolled rage with magic.
<ul><li>Furthermore, if she was indeed an Obscurial her interactions with a young <a href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Grindelwald</a> could also explain why the Dark Wizard was later so interested by the power of an Obscurus or Obscurial. Ariana also lived longer than the average Obscurial, having died at the age of 14, whereas most Obscurials (with the exception of <a href="/wiki/Credence_Barebone" title="Credence Barebone">Credence Barebone</a>) didn't live past age 10, at least those that were documented. If Ariana was an Obscurial, then this was a fact kept hidden by the Dumbledores, since it was widely believed no Obscurial had existed for at least two hundred years, even thirty years after her death, and that none lived longer than ten years of age.</li>
<li>If Ariana was indeed an Obscurial, it could make her one of two in her family, due to Credence Barebone possibly being a close relative of hers.</li></ul></li></ul>
