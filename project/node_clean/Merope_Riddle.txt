Generations of inbreeding left the <a href="/wiki/House_of_Gaunt" title="House of Gaunt">Gaunts</a> violent, mentally unstable, and poverty-stricken.
</p><p>Merope exhibited little <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magical</a> talent in her early years, and as a result was mentally and physically abused by her father, who called her a "<i>disgusting little <a href="/wiki/Squib" title="Squib">Squib</a></i>", among other things. However, this was actually a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Merope's magical abilities were suppressed largely <i>because</i> of her father's abuse. It should be noted that a person's magical abilities can be affected by their state of mind, and powerful negative emotions endured on a chronic basis can interfere with or completely drain a person's powers, as <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> pointed out. By extension, it can be inferred that Merope had magical powers, but had never really used them nor developed them.
</p><p>However, Merope's magical ability flourished after her father and brother were incarcerated in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> and she was free from their abuse; she showed herself capable of significant magic, enslaving <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle</a> either with the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a> or a <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a> for an extended period of time.<sup id="cite_ref-HBP10_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP10-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> It is unlikely that Merope attended <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, though she did own a <a href="/wiki/Wand" title="Wand">wand</a>; it seems likely that she was taught <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a> at home. Another possibility is that Merope disciplined herself to the extent to become self-taught. Merope seemed to be in charge of cooking and cleaning in her family home; it is unknown what happened to her mother.

<dd></dd></dl></div><p>At some point in her life, Merope secretly fell in love with <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle</a>, an exceptionally handsome and wealthy <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a>, and the only child of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Riddle" title="Thomas Riddle">Thomas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mary_Riddle" title="Mary Riddle">Mary Riddle</a>, who lived nearby. Her father was livid when Morfin revealed this to him in the summer of <a href="/wiki/1925" title="1925">1925</a>, and attacked her physically, but was restrained by <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry</a> official <a href="/wiki/Bob_Ogden" title="Bob Ogden">Bob Ogden</a>. Ogden arrested both Marvolo and Morfin, who had <a href="/wiki/Curse" title="Curse">cursed</a> Riddle because his sister found him attractive. With <a href="/wiki/House_of_Gaunt" title="House of Gaunt">her family</a> gone, Merope manipulated Riddle into marrying her. She left the shack with a <a href="/wiki/Merope_Gaunt%27s_note" title="Merope Gaunt&#39;s note">farewell note</a> revealing her marriage to Riddle, and her existence was never again mentioned by Marvolo.
</p><p>Although <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, upon learning of these events, speculated that she might have used the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a> or a Love Potion on Riddle, Dumbledore believed that she most likely used a <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a> because it seemed more romantic. Dumbledore also speculated that she could administer the love potion to him while mixing it with water or some other beverage. In any case, Riddle became infatuated with her and they were <a href="/wiki/Wedding_of_Tom_Riddle_Senior_and_Merope_Gaunt" title="Wedding of Tom Riddle Senior and Merope Gaunt">married</a> in late <a href="/wiki/1925" title="1925">1925</a>, running away to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> together.

</p><p>After a year of marriage, Merope Gaunt soon became pregnant and decided to release Riddle from his mental enslavement, having grown tired of living a lie. Dumbledore thought that she did this hoping either that <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">her husband</a> would have truly fallen in <a href="/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a> with her by that point, or that he would at least stay for the sake of <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">their unborn child</a>. Unfortunately for her, Riddle did nothing of the kind. Riddle awoke into a nightmare and fled back to <a href="/wiki/Riddle_family" title="Riddle family">his family's</a> <a href="/wiki/Riddle_House" title="Riddle House">home</a>, believing to have been <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">bewitched</a>, although according to Albus Dumbledore, he probably did not say that exactly, for fear of being thought insane.

Specifically, she sold her <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin%27s_locket" class="mw-redirect" title="Salazar Slytherin&#39;s locket">locket</a>, a family heirloom which was one of her father’s most treasured ones, to Caractacus Burke for only ten <a href="/wiki/Galleon" title="Galleon">Galleons</a>, either not knowing that it was a priceless artefact, no longer caring, or a desire to sever ties with her abusive father and valuing the paltry profits much more than the painful reminder of her family. With her heart broken and her dreams in tatters, Merope stopped using <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a> altogether after Riddle's desertion, not even willing to raise her wand to save her own life (although, according to Dumbledore, it was also possible that her powers may have been sapped as a result of depression and also because of her unrequited love for Riddle).<sup id="cite_ref-HBP13_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-HBP13-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>On the night of <a href="/wiki/31_December" title="31 December">New Year's Eve</a> in <a href="/wiki/1926" title="1926">1926</a>, she staggered up the front steps of an <a href="/wiki/Wool%27s_Orphanage" title="Wool&#39;s Orphanage">orphanage</a>, ready to give birth to a son. She told <a href="/wiki/Cole" title="Cole">Mrs Cole</a>, a woman who worked in the orphanage, to name him <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom</a> for his father, <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt" title="Marvolo Gaunt">Marvolo</a> for her father, and <a href="/wiki/Riddle_family" title="Riddle family">Riddle</a> to be his surname. Mrs Cole believed Marvolo was a "funny name", and wondered whether Merope had come from a circus. Merope died without warning, within an hour, and her last words were a final wish that her son would turn out to look like his father, which Mrs Cole said that she was right to hope it since Merope was no beauty. It is unknown what happened to Merope’s body after her death.

</p><p>Her son would grow up believing his father married Merope of his own free will, only leaving her after discovering she was a witch.

<dd>&#8212;Reflection on Merope's choice to die<sup class="noprint"><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">[src]</a></sup></dd>
<dd></dd></dl></div><p>Merope was physically and emotionally abused by her family, and as a result was timid and miserable for most of her life, traumatised to the point of being unable to perform magic well. She could perform magic, but having been terrified of her father and brother, lacked confidence; thus, her magic was haphazard at best. However, she grew bolder and happier once Marvolo and Morfin were sent to Azkaban and displayed enough cunning and magical skill to manipulate the man she was in love with into marrying her. By extension, she seems to have also been able to effectively manipulate her husband when he was under her control as to prevent him from becoming suspicious about the truth of their marriage and resisting her.
</p><p>She loved Tom Riddle Snr obsessively, given the lengths to which she went to obtain his affection and her morbid depression after he left. Even the responsibility of having a baby to look after was not enough to give Merope the will to live. Her obsession seemed to have grew into a desire for a genuine affectionate relationship as opposed to living a lie any further; she ceased her enslavement of Tom in hopes that he would have truly fallen in love with her, or at least remain for their unborn child. Her naivety proved to be her undoing, as Tom felt nothing for his captor, and fled to never return.
</p><p>Having lived a life where she had always been miserable, Merope had no hope left and could not find the courage to make her want to keep trying, even for the sake of her newborn son. This decision had a dramatically negative impact on her son's psyche. Despite this making Merope responsible for the creation of the most dangerous dark wizard of all time, both Albus Dumbledore and even if reluctantly, Harry Potter sympathised with her upbringing and did not bore her a grudge for it, with Dumbledore stating one should not judge her too harshly, as she had been greatly weakened by long suffering which resulted in her choosing to die instead of staying alive for her son, and she never had the courage and inner-strength of <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily Evans</a>, Harry Potter's mother, who sacrificed herself willingly for her son.
</p><p>One point as to why Merope may have chosen to seek out a muggle location to give birth rather then to seek sanctuary with other witches/wizards may also have been influenced by the miserable life she had lived up-unto that point; it's likely that after everything that had happened, and now so traumatised to the point of being unable to perform magic, Merope came to view magic as having been the root of all her problems in life one way or another (her father's treatment of her her whole life, etc.), and that her choosing to go to a muggle orphanage over Saint Mungo's, after she'd already gone into labour, may have been a final act of love on her part, wanting her unborn child as far from magicals as she could get.

</div><p>Merope's relationship with her father and brother was a violent one where they treated her more like a slave than family, and forced her to do all the housework. Her father, Marvolo, who placed the utmost importance on his heritage, tended to use words such as "squib" as putdowns and to make insinuations about blood status when as a form of insult. Marvolo became furious with Merope's infatuation with a <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> leading to the involvement of authorities and a stint in prison. Morfin made fun of Merope's romantic feelings for <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle</a>, and laughed while watching Marvolo abuse her.
</p><p>She was physically and emotionally abused by her family, and as a result was timid and miserable for most of her life, traumatised to the point of being unable to perform <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a>. Upon discovering that Merope was a <a href="/wiki/Blood_traitor" title="Blood traitor">blood traitor</a>, Marvolo went as far as to attempt to murder her in front of a Ministry official. She grew bolder and happier once <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt" title="Marvolo Gaunt">Marvolo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Morfin_Gaunt" title="Morfin Gaunt">Morfin</a> were sent to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>, and displayed enough cunning and magical skill to brew a <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a>. However, Marvolo was shocked when he learned that Merope had left the house, despite never loving her to begin with, and never mentioned her name or existence ever again, and this was probably a shock that led to his death (or possibly due to Merope no longer feeding him, as he never learned to feed himself). Morfin then felt that Merope had betrayed him and Marvolo, for marrying that "filthy Muggle".
</p><p>Despite a lifetime of abuse at the hands of her father, Merope did give her son her father's name as a middle name, showing she might have had lingering affections for her father, sentiments that were not reciprocated. An alternative explanation could be that Merope chose to name her son "Tom Marvolo Riddle" because she was likely reflecting on her life in her dying moments, and "Tom" and "Marvolo" were among the few male names that came to mind. This could be due to her Gaunt upbringing leaving her with very few men in her life to truly interact with aside from Marvolo and Morfin before her marriage.

<dd></dd></dl></div><p><a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle</a> was a handsome and wealthy Muggle, who lived near Merope's house. Like many people in Little Hangleton, Tom looked on with disdain on her <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt" title="Marvolo Gaunt">father</a> and <a href="/wiki/Morfin_Gaunt" title="Morfin Gaunt">brother</a>, because of their poverty, their strange shabby appearances, and antisocial tendencies to those around them.

This turned out to be a fatal mistake; Tom, feeling as if he'd woken up from a nightmare, immediately escaped Merope to never return, claiming he had been "hoodwinked" and "taken in". It was speculated among his neighbours that he had been tricked into thinking he was the father of her unborn child. Merope was heartbroken and devastated by this, to the point of losing the will to live, and later died shortly after giving birth to his son.

<p>After <a href="/wiki/Marriage" title="Marriage">marrying</a> <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle_Senior" title="Tom Riddle Senior">Tom Riddle Snr</a>, Merope became pregnant with her first and only child, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Tom Marvolo Riddle</a>. After her husband left her, finally being freed from the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Love_Potion" class="mw-redirect" title="Love Potion">Love Potion</a>, Merope became depressed, and when her child was born, she died soon afterwards, not wishing to live anymore, and not wanting to use <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magic</a> to save her life. She told Mrs Cole that she wanted her son to be called Tom, after his father, Marvolo, after Merope's father and that the child's last name was to be Riddle. Merope also hoped that her son looked like his father. Merope got her wish; Tom Marvolo Riddle was described as looking very like his father, who was very good looking.
</p><p>Tom Riddle grew up at <a href="/wiki/Wool%27s_Orphanage" title="Wool&#39;s Orphanage">Wool's Orphanage</a>, not knowing about his family members. When <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> visited Tom, and told him that he was a <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a>, Tom hoped that it came from his father, but was disappointed to find that he got it from the maternal side of his family, when after considerable research of the school registry he could not find Tom Riddle Senior as a Hogwarts alumnus. After getting an incomplete story of his parents from his uncle Morfin Gaunt, Riddle flew in a rage. He stole his uncle's wand, then killed his father, grandmother and grandfather, returned Morfin's wand, then stole the <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_ring" class="mw-redirect" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s ring">Gaunt family heirloom ring</a>, framing Morfin for the crime.
</p><p>It was due to Merope's choice of losing her will to live that she never had a chance to give Tom the love and care he desperately required, leading him to grow up to become a being completely unable to understand the concept of love, thus leading him to repeatedly tear apart his <a href="/wiki/Soul" title="Soul">soul</a>, and eventually his death lead him to an eternally crippled state in <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">limbo</a>.

This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades_(mythology)" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Pleiades (mythology)">Merope</a> was a nymph who married a mortal, Sisyphus, and bore him a son, Glaucus; some myths say that she is the dullest of the seven stars because she brought shame upon herself for marrying a mortal. Merope Gaunt's marriage to a Muggle may be an allusion to this marriage, as both suffered a resulting "fading away", and both Meropes faced mortality after their respective marriages. Also, Merope of mythology was the seventh sister, and <a href="/wiki/Seven" title="Seven">seven</a> is the most <a href="/wiki/Magic" title="Magic">magically</a> powerful number, perhaps alluding to her incredibly powerful <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">son</a>, who would later plan to <a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">split his soul</a> into seven pieces in an attempt to achieve immortality.
<ul><li>The name is also used in the famous Greek play, <i>Oedipus Rex</i>, written by Sophocles in 425 BC. The name, Merope, is given to the main character's adoptive mother. As in <i>Oedipus Rex</i>, the son of Merope in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(book_series)" title="Harry Potter (book series)"><i>Harry Potter</i> series</a> killed his father, although the difference being Tom had done so out of premeditated malice, whereas Oedipus had done so through a misconstrued prophecy that he would do so, and placed himself into exile as he resolved never to harm his kindly parents, King Polybus and Queen Merope. Getting into a fight with King Laius of Thebes, Oedipus fought back and struck Laius dead, never knowing Laius was his true father (until much later in his life).</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li>Merope and her family were cut from the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K.

<ul><li>Alternatively, the same may be applied if Voldemort had been adopted and then raised in a loving environment.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt%27s_ring" class="mw-redirect" title="Marvolo Gaunt&#39;s ring">Marvolo Gaunt's ring</a> is said to have belonged to Merope, while <a href="/wiki/Marvolo_Gaunt" title="Marvolo Gaunt">Marvolo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Morfin_Gaunt" title="Morfin Gaunt">Morfin Gaunt</a> aren't even mentioned. However, in a deleted scene in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry</a> tells <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> that the ring belonged to Marvolo and that the locket belonged to Merope.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>It can be said that Merope died of despair as she gave up trying to live after her husband, Tom Riddle Snr, had left.</li>
<li>It is unknown how Voldemort viewed his mother, but it would appear he had a low opinion of her, thinking her to be a weak witch if she died so easily after his birth.</li>
<li>Merope's infatuation with Tom Riddle Snr seems to mirror that of <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>'s with their <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">son</a>.</li>
<li>Both Merope and her granddaughter, <a href="/wiki/Delphini" title="Delphini">Delphini</a>, would grow up in unhappy households and would not attend <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>.</li>
<li>Merope forcing Riddle to marry her by a love potion for the conception of their son, in addition to Merope's belief that Riddle was obligated to love her now simply due to that they had a child is symbolic for Voldemort's inability to understand love as it was due to betwitchment rather than true love, directing the Riddle Jnr's entire life to achieving <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">immortality</a> and absolute power by sinking into the deepest concept of the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a> (<a href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>) and resurface as the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Wizard" title="Dark Wizard">darkest wizard</a> of the 20th century, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Voldemort's mother's one-sided possessive desire for his father and Riddle only being with Merope due to magic can be contrasted with the mutual love of Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, both of whom were willing to do everything for the other's happiness instead of their own. Merope giving up on life when she lost control of Riddle Snr rather than live for the sake of her son is also contrasted with Lily giving her life to save Harry from Voldemort.</li></ul>
