He thus had complete control of the <a href="/wiki/British_Ministry_of_Magic" title="British Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a>, the main governing body of the British <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a>. Fudge began his career in the Ministry as Junior Minister in the <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Magical_Accidents_and_Catastrophes" title="Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes">Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes</a>. He then succeeded <a href="/wiki/Millicent_Bagnold" title="Millicent Bagnold">Millicent Bagnold</a> as Minister for Magic, and thus had the responsibility of meeting with the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister" title="Prime Minister">Muggle Prime Minister</a> when necessary.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1992" title="1992">1992</a>-<a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a>, Fudge had to deal with the <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood_supremacy" title="Pure-blood supremacy">pure-blood supremacist</a> criticism directed against Head of the <a href="/wiki/Misuse_of_Muggle_Artefacts_Office" title="Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office">Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office</a> <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>'s proposal of a <a href="/wiki/Muggle_Protection_Act" title="Muggle Protection Act">Muggle Protection Act</a>, which was nonetheless losing reputation when Weasley was found in possession of a  <a href="/wiki/Flying_Ford_Anglia" title="Flying Ford Anglia">Flying Ford Anglia</a> and his daughter <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a> started carrying out attacks on <a href="/wiki/Muggle-born" title="Muggle-born">Muggle-born</a> students at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School</a>, using the <a href="/wiki/Serpent_of_Slytherin" title="Serpent of Slytherin">Basilisk</a> concealed within the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>; as Fudge believed the legend surrounding the Chamber to be a threat to society as well as to the boy <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, he took Hogwarts <a href="/wiki/Keeper_of_Keys_and_Grounds" title="Keeper of Keys and Grounds">gamekeeper</a> <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for his alleged connection to the attacks. 
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a>-<a href="/wiki/1994" title="1994">1994</a>, Fudge had to deal with assumed mass-murderer <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>'s escape from Azkaban. As Fudge believed Black to be a threat to society as well as to Harry, he had <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> stationed at Hogwarts and in <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a>. However, Black narrowly escaped from Fudge's fingers. 
</p><p>During the summer holiday, he organised the <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_World_Cup" title="Quidditch World Cup">Quidditch World Cup</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a> with <a href="/wiki/Ludovic_Bagman" title="Ludovic Bagman">Ludo Bagman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">Bartemius Crouch Senior</a>. After <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>'s death in the Tournament and Harry claiming <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Voldemort</a> had returned, Fudge refused to believe it, because it would mean the end of the peace he and the Ministry had worked so hard to maintain for the last thirteen years. Instead, he used his influence at the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">Daily Prophet</a></i> to launch a <a href="/wiki/Campaign_to_discredit_Albus_Dumbledore_and_Harry_Potter" title="Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter">smear campaign</a> against both Harry and <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, as Fudge was paranoid that Dumbledore was after his job and was simply telling lies. 
</p><p>However, following the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, Fudge saw Voldemort with his own eyes and was forced to admit that Harry and Dumbledore had been telling the truth the whole time, causing the wizarding community to protest and scream for his resignation. He was replaced as Minister for Magic by <a href="/wiki/Rufus_Scrimgeour" title="Rufus Scrimgeour">Rufus Scrimgeour</a>, but stayed in an advisory capacity and communicated news of the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a> to the Muggle Prime Minister if Scrimgeour was unable to. 
</p><p>His reputation and image had been completely destroyed and he became known as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy what the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">Wizarding community</a> tried so hard to rebuild, and his cowardice, arrogance and incompetence led him to become the most disgraced and least effective Minister in British wizarding history.

<p>In June, Fudge arrived at Hogwarts again, this time for two reasons: first, to check on the Black situation, and second, to witness the execution of <a href="/wiki/Buckbeak" title="Buckbeak">Buckbeak</a> the Hippogriff. At two o'clock, Fudge attended Buckbeak's appeal, but the <a href="/wiki/Committee_for_the_Disposal_of_Dangerous_Creatures" title="Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures">Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures</a> did not reverse its decision. At five that evening, Fudge returned to Hagrid's cabin to witness the execution, but when <a href="/wiki/Walden_Macnair" title="Walden Macnair">Macnair</a> stepped outside to perform the act, he noticed that Buckbeak had disappeared.
</p><p>When <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> returned Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Black to the school after the <a href="/wiki/Encounter_at_the_Shrieking_Shack" title="Encounter at the Shrieking Shack">events in the Shrieking Shack</a>, Fudge informed him that for his actions, Fudge would try to wangle an Order of Merlin, Second or First Class for him. Moments later, Fudge entered the hospital wing after hearing Harry's shouts; Harry and Hermione attempted to convince Fudge that <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> was still alive, to no avail. Several minutes later, when Professor Dumbledore arrived to speak privately with Harry and Hermione, Fudge decided to meet the Dementors and rendezvous with Dumbledore later. While talking to Snape soon after, he said he suspected that once Harry was back in his right mind he would want to tell the Prophet exactly how Snape saved him.
</p><p>When they learned Black had escaped again, Fudge returned with Snape and Dumbledore to the hospital wing, where Snape furiously ordered Harry to explain his involvement. However, Fudge seemed to think Harry being involved was impossible, and left to inform the Ministry about the situation, and agreed to remove the Dementors from the grounds due to their attempt to use the Dementor's Kiss on Harry the previous night.

<p>Paranoid that Dumbledore may have had designs on the role of Minister himself, Fudge refused to believe the warning that Voldemort had returned. Fudge's decision was also influenced by one of <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a>'s articles about Harry. In the article Skeeter wrote that Harry's scar had long-term negative effects on his mental health. This led Fudge to suggest that Harry may have been hallucinating. This made Harry an unreliable witness in Fudge's mind; when Harry started naming the identities of the Death Eaters who returned to Voldemort's side, he could only identify those who had been cleared by the Wizengamot, which Fudge claimed Harry could have looked up in old copies of the <i>Daily Prophet</i>, and took it as a great offence.
</p><p>Dumbledore, however, insisted that the situation was still salvageable if they took the necessary precautions; they needed to remove Azkaban from the control of the Dementors and send peace envoys to the giants. Fudge was horrified at the mere prospect of both of these stating it would mean the end of his career if he did either one. Dumbledore, in turn, countered that Fudge was blinded by the love of his office, and his own prejudices. He provided a warning that the decision Fudge made here and now, would affect how he was remembered in the future: If Fudge took the necessary measures, he would be hailed as a hero throughout the ages, whether he remained in office or not. If he did nothing, then he would be immortalised as a coward who allowed Voldemort the opportunity to try and destroy the world they tried so hard to rebuild. 
However, Fudge saw Dumbledore's suggestions as ludicrous (fearing he would be forced out of office for even suggesting it). As such he and Dumbledore acknowledged that they had reached a parting of a parting of the ways; Fudge was left to act as he saw fit, while Dumbledore acted immediately to reactivate the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>. Even a screaming argument with <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> and seeing <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>'s reactivated <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a> branding did not convince Fudge in the very least; if anything, he was increasingly angry at Minerva and revolted at Severus. Before leaving the school, Fudge was courteous enough to hand Harry his winnings for the Tournament, though he cancelled the award ceremony due to the circumstances.<sup id="cite_ref-GOF36_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GOF36-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup>

<p>When Harry was accused of using magic illegally in the presence of a Muggle, Fudge took a leading role in Harry's prosecution before the <a href="/wiki/Wizengamot" title="Wizengamot">Wizengamot</a>. He actively sought to discredit Harry, going so far as to change the time and location of the hearing in an attempt to make him miss it. During the actual hearing he introduced irrelevant considerations and highly biased accusations based around Harry's past offences; offences he himself excused. While at the same time seeking to deny Harry's right to a fair chance to present his side of events. Only the intervention of witness <a href="/wiki/Arabella_Figg" title="Arabella Figg">Arabella Figg</a> and Dumbledore himself spared Harry from expulsion, though Fudge attempted to deny their testimonies and unfairly voted for Harry's conviction himself. After the hearing, Fudge outright ignored Harry and Arthur Weasley as he walked past them.

<p>Driven by paranoia, Fudge sought to undermine Dumbledore's credibility and authority both at Hogwarts and at large in the wizarding world, which he accomplished, first by ensuring that Dumbledore was presented in the <a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">news</a> as a crackpot. Soon afterwards, Fudge's Senior Undersecretary, <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>, was installed at Hogwarts as the school's new <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> Professor. Fudge had Umbridge teach Hogwarts students to read their textbooks instead of practising defensive spells, out of a paranoid belief that Dumbledore intended to train his students into an army to overtake the Ministry. By means of numerous Ministry <a href="/wiki/Educational_Decree" title="Educational Decree">decrees</a>, Fudge gradually extended her powers while suppressing Dumbledore's and Harry's freedom of expressing their claims. Fudge eventually handed full control of Hogwarts to Umbridge when, one evening, Harry was caught violating <a href="/wiki/Educational_Decree_Number_Twenty-Four" title="Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four">Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four</a>; Dumbledore took the blame and escaped after swiftly defeating Fudge, Umbridge, <a href="/wiki/Kingsley_Shacklebolt" title="Kingsley Shacklebolt">Kingsley Shacklebolt</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Dawlish" title="John Dawlish">John Dawlish</a>, thus being dismissed as headmaster and became a wanted criminal.<sup id="cite_ref-OOTP_27-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OOTP-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After the <a href="/wiki/Azkaban_escapes#1996" title="Azkaban escapes">mass breakout</a> of <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> in 1996, Fudge continued to refuse to believe Harry and Dumbledore, instead suggesting that <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> was the leader of the breakout, due to the fact that he and <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> were cousins, either unaware or neglecting that Sirius had been disowned by his family and the two were mortal enemies. Throughout all of this, Fudge unknowingly became an ally to Voldermort, giving him an entire year to rebuild his forces uninterrupted. Because Fudge ignored Dumbledore's previous warnings, Voldemort was also able to convince the Dementors, Giants and other factions mistreated by the Ministry to join him. The Dementors' defection also allowed Voldemort to free the majority of his loyal followers, including Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius, amongst other falsely-reformed Death Eaters, remained in Fudge's trust, while discreetly manipulating him to assist their master and their own benefits. While the Order and Harry considered the possibility of Fudge being under the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>, Dumbledore believed otherwise, which was of little comfort. Within a year of his return, Voldemort had a sizeable, still growing army at his disposal and was ready to begin his conquest.

</p><p>However, this was ultimately a facade to hide his true colours, as Fudge was in fact an extremely prejudiced individual, a trait that seemed to rub off on his puppet, <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>. He seemed to favour people born with high status, particularly the <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_family" title="Malfoy family">Malfoys</a>, over lower class, such as the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasleys</a>, as seen in his friendship with <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> and selective neglect of <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>, all the while being unable to tell Lucius was manipulating him. Also, despite being accepting towards Muggles, Fudge appeared to favour pure-bloods, and showed little respect for <a href="/wiki/Squib" title="Squib">Squibs</a> and <a href="/wiki/Half-breed" title="Half-breed">half-breeds</a>, as he spoke in disinterest when interrogating <a href="/wiki/Arabella_Figg" title="Arabella Figg">Arabella Figg</a>, while on two known occasions irrationally accusing <a href="/wiki/Half-giant" title="Half-giant">half-giants</a> of murder; first <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a> of killing <a href="/wiki/Myrtle_Warren" title="Myrtle Warren">Myrtle</a>, and later <a href="/wiki/Olympe_Maxime" title="Olympe Maxime">Olympe Maxime</a> of killing <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">Barty Crouch</a>; Fudge neglected Arthur due to believing the man's obsession with Muggles to be a telltale sign of lacking "proper wizarding pride". When Dumbledore offered to summon the <a href="/wiki/House-elf" title="House-elf">house-elf</a> <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Disciplinary_hearing_of_Harry_Potter" title="Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter">hearing</a> for testimony, Fudge blatantly stated that he had no time to listen to house-elves, showing his disregard for what he considered to be an inferior species, and his overall belief that the elves are lower than wizards, indicating he could be prejudiced against sentient creatures in general.
</p><p>His favouritism had limits, though, for he was not so hasty to imprison Rubeus Hagrid as compared to Olympe Maxime, possibly due to the male half-giant's relationship with Dumbledore. Even so, he turned a blind eye to Lucius Malfoy's own record as a Death Eater because he was cleared in the past (as Lucius lied about being under the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>) as well as his vaunted position in Wizarding society and frequent cash donations. He was rather tactless, as he was making crude body gestures to communicate with the <a href="/wiki/Oblansk" title="Oblansk">Bulgarian Minister for Magic</a> and revolted aloud the moment he saw <a href="/wiki/Marietta_Edgecombe" title="Marietta Edgecombe">Marietta Edgecombe</a>'s disfigured face, having little sensitivity to the girl's feelings. Upon discovering Harry was a <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parselmouth</a>, Fudge caved into prejudice, and started to doubt Harry simply because he could speak a language that was usually affiliated with the <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark Arts</a>, making him comparable to <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Macmillan" title="Ernest Macmillan">Ernest Macmillan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a>. His arrogance, in fact, was egregious enough for him to award himself with the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Merlin" title="Order of Merlin">Order of Merlin</a>, First class medal, which caused controversies throughout the community, as it was common view that Fudge's career was "less than distinguished".<sup id="cite_ref-PMordermerlin_18-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PMordermerlin-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>

</div>
<p>Despite his claims that he always strove to figure out what was best for everyone, Fudge was ultimately a delusional and selfish hypocrite, a sycophant who favoured peace and tranquillity for the sake of his own position over a truth that would cause disruption of that peace. This was demonstrated when he was reluctant to tell <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> the supposed reason for <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>'s escape from <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>, due to not wanting to worry Harry, despite the importance to Harry's safety. Preferring to tell the public what they wanted to hear instead of what they needed to hear, and deluding even himself with such lies, Fudge would use virtually any means to cover up the truth as long as he deemed the evidence to be insufficient, and would not hesitate to ruin the reputation of those who dared to oppose him, even if it meant abusing the powers of his position and making changes in the laws to do so. Even prior to his dismissal, Fudge attempted to persuade Harry to lie to the wizarding world that the Ministry was performing well in security and maintenance, despite how he mistreated Harry for an entire year, as well as the fact that his inadequacy had already endangered the entire world by denying Voldemort's return; he was seemingly more desperate in saving his own career and reputation than repairing the damage he inflicted to the community's defences against the Death Eaters, making him a truly remorseless and self-centered wizard. He created several new <a href="/wiki/Educational_Decree" title="Educational Decree">rules and regulations</a> at Hogwarts in order to increase control and chances to punish students through his puppet Umbridge, despite many of them being ridiculous and unfair. Fudge also used falsified propaganda to maintain his own position at the expense of those who he believed were his enemies, even if that so-called enemy was someone who had helped him out for many years, to which he had no trouble in being ungrateful, and then later shamelessly asking favours from people he had offended, the result of a welled-up penchant for corruption harboured for years in context.
</p><p>Fudge also appeared to be more reactive than proactive; he would often wait for a solution to appear, rather than take the initiative and <i>create</i> a solution. Because of his indecisive nature, he would often ask Dumbledore for advice in his early days as Minister. Unfortunately, when Fudge <i>did</i> take the initiative and make his own decisions in attempt of accomplishing his job, they were often misguided and led to disastrous consequences, such as when he placed Dementors at Hogwarts to recapture Sirius Black, which led to students being traumatised and Harry Potter to nearly receive the Dementor's Kiss at the end of the school year. He later insisted on summoning a Dementor to <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Junior" title="Bartemius Crouch Junior">Barty Crouch Jnr</a>'s interrogation for his own protection, despite knowing that Barty had been <a href="/wiki/Incarcerous_Spell" title="Incarcerous Spell">restrained</a> and guarded by <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">Professor</a> <a href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">McGonagall</a>, and the possibility that the Dementor would attack the prisoner on sight, which did happen, resulting in the destruction of their most critical piece of evidence at that time. His trust of Dementors also proved useful when he vehemently denied a Dementor would go anywhere near <a href="/wiki/Little_Whinging" title="Little Whinging">Little Whinging</a> in his attempt to discredit Harry Potter.

<p>However, the mistake that led to Fudge's undoing was when he led a <a href="/wiki/Campaign_to_discredit_Albus_Dumbledore_and_Harry_Potter" title="Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter">smear campaign</a> against Dumbledore and Harry Potter, denying the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a> the chance to protect themselves and effectively allowing Voldemort a full year to build his forces uninterrupted. With each passing month, his facade as a well-meaning and harmlessly eccentric man waned further and further. Even after his folly had been exposed, Fudge was more concerned about his own reputation than actual security and attempted to deceive the community by persuading Harry to tell them the Ministry under him was achieving positive results, which would have endangered them further by giving them a false sense of security. Despite this, he was willing to stand against Voldemort and showed more courage in this regard than Umbridge did, as he refused to step aside as Minister when threatened, though due to poor preparations Fudge failed to prevent Voldemort from causing the <a href="/wiki/Brockdale_Bridge" title="Brockdale Bridge">Brockdale Bridge</a> to collapse, and while he cited that no one in their right mind would yield to such blackmail, it was highly likely that this was another of his desperate attempt to remain in office.
</p><p>The only known case where Fudge was reluctant to act against his better judgement was the case of Hagrid in spring 1993. While he knew that Hagrid's record was against him, he didn't wish to send him to Azkaban for supposedly opening the Chamber of Secrets without definitive evidence. But Fudge couldn't put off the pressure from the Ministry forever. The situation wasn't entirely hopeless: Fudge promised that if proven innocent, Hagrid would be released and given an apology. In the end, the Minister proved as good as his word.
</p><p>Nevertheless, Fudge was, at his core, an extremely arrogant, paranoid, delusional and selfish person. He believed himself to be the smart one, and Albus Dumbledore a troublemaker who conspired to overthrow him for the post of Minister for Magic (despite the fact that Dumbledore had previously refused the post three times when offered) and apparently being more ungrateful for Dumbledore's years of friendly and helpful advice. This was partly due to Fudge remembering Dumbledore's superiority and popularity in the past and present. As stated before, this paranoia was usually kept suppressed, as Fudge continued to (in public) respect Dumbledore over the years, and accepted many of Dumbledore's decisions. By ignoring the professor, however, Fudge had metaphorically shot himself in the foot. With Dumbledore's help over the years, Fudge grew more confident on his own, which made him delude himself into believing that his poorly made choices were correct, making him, in a much more twisted way than Umbridge, the hero in his own story. His increasing lack of preventive action affected his popularity with the wizarding world: despite Fudge's efforts of keeping control, several people chose to believe Dumbledore and Harry over him, and by the summer of 1996, he had been forced to resign from office in disgrace and replaced by the more proactive <a href="/wiki/Rufus_Scrimgeour" title="Rufus Scrimgeour">Rufus Scrimgeour</a>.
</p><p>However, despite all his faults, Fudge was not devoid of redeeming qualities; although it is unclear how many of them were to avoid projecting an air of tyranny, and how many came from his own heart. Even Umbridge believed that she would be crossing a line by using the <a href="/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses" title="Unforgivable Curses">Unforgivable Curses</a> with his knowledge, since after <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> speculated retribution from Fudge, she did not hesitate to agree with the teenager. He also demonstrated compassion when he protested Dumbledore's suspension as Headmaster of Hogwarts, even though the motion had already been carried. He also intended to protect Harry from the recently escaped Sirius Black to the best of his ability. After hearing that the Dementors had attacked Harry twice within Hogwarts' grounds, he had the sense to order them immediately away from the school. At times, Fudge could develop a sense of humour as well: he once assured Harry that "<i>the Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban for blowing up their aunts</i>". He also sarcastically responded that Harry might have "a twin brother" when Dumbledore attempted to absolve him of forming the DA.
</p><p>Although his behaviour throughout 1995 made him appear to be such, Fudge was not a totally unreasonable man and was more rational than Umbridge or Voldemort by nature, as he simply buried himself in his own self-denial, love of office, delusions and paranoia. He was capable of admitting when he was wrong, but only with damnable and solid evidence which he could see with his own eyes. After witnessing Voldemort's return with his own eyes, Fudge could no longer bury himself in lies and cleared Dumbledore's and Harry's names alongside the names of notable members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> unjustly persecuted by the Ministry (most notably Rubeus Hagrid, Arthur Weasley, Sirius Black), at the price of him being removed from his position. For instance, he was able to admit to the Muggle Prime Minister, with somewhat humbleness, that starting a ruthless manhunt for Sirius Black may have been aimless since he was in fact innocent all along, which Fudge realised when he learned that Black was killed by <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">his own cousin</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a> (despite incorrectly believing earlier that the two were working together). Interestingly, however, in the article in the <i>Daily Prophet</i> absolving Dumbledore and Harry, it states the two of them prevailed despite being constantly slandered, ignoring the fact that it was Fudge who ordered the <i>Daily Prophet</i> itself to do such. Additionally, even though he already turned against Harry Potter at the time due to his paranoia and refusal to accept Voldemort's return, he was still courteous enough to personally hand Harry his Triwizard winnings but was unable to hold a celebration due to the circumstances of <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>'s death.

<p>In Fudge's early days as <a href="/wiki/Minister_for_Magic" title="Minister for Magic">Minister for Magic</a>, he was forever bombarding Albus Dumbledore for help and advice. In return he expressed confidence in Dumbledore. When <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> had an Order of Suspension for Dumbledore due to his failure to prevent petrification-attacks on students, Fudge was against the suspension, saying it was the "<i>last thing we want just now,</i>" and "<i>if Dumbledore can't stop them... who can?</i>"
</p><p>Besides advice, it seems that Albus Dumbledore informed Fudge of important events at Hogwarts, such as Sirius Black's and Buckbeak's escape from there being due to "a reversal of time." Apparently, he did not inform Fudge that <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> was a <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parselmouth</a>, and learned of it after <a href="/wiki/Rita_Skeeter" title="Rita Skeeter">Rita Skeeter</a>'s article in the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Prophet" title="Daily Prophet">Daily Prophet</a></i>.
</p><p>Over the years, though, Fudge became paranoid that Dumbledore was seeking the Minister position for himself, despite Dumbledore clearly showing lack of interest in the position, rejecting it at least three times. This paranoia was kept suppressed, as Fudge continued to respect Dumbledore over the years and accepted his decisions, despite their eccentricity. Despite constantly seeking advice from the more able wizard, Fudge would nevertheless succumb to the public's views and sometimes go against Dumbledore's insistence on certain issues, such as sending Hagrid to <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> or placing <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> around <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> as guardians. Fudge was only successful in gaining the people's confidence because they knew he was willing to accept Dumbledore's advice.
</p><p>However, in 1995, after Dumbledore told him that Voldemort had returned, Fudge refused to believe him, even when Severus Snape showed him the reactivated <a href="/wiki/Dark_Mark" title="Dark Mark">Dark Mark</a>, as he finally succumbed to his paranoia. As a result, Fudge started a <a href="/wiki/Campaign_to_discredit_Albus_Dumbledore_and_Harry_Potter" title="Campaign to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter">smear campaign</a> to discredit and ruin Albus' reputation, ungratefully rejecting and forgetting all the assistance and advice he received from Dumbledore for the past years. As an attempt to wrest control of Hogwarts from Dumbledore, he appointed <a href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher against the headmaster's will, and <a href="/wiki/Educational_Decree" title="Educational Decree">empowered</a> her greatly and eventually attempted (in failure) to arrest Dumbledore on a trumped-up charge.
</p><p>After seeing Voldemort's return in the Ministry, Fudge was forced to accept it all, as well as reinstate Albus' reputation. Following this, Fudge resigned as Minister in disgrace because he refused to take the steps Dumbledore offered him. When Fudge requested Dumbledore to persuade Harry Potter to lie for the Ministry's behalf to the wizarding world in a last ditch effort to cling onto his position, Dumbledore refused, seeing no more desire or purpose in helping Cornelius.
</p><p>In 1997, Fudge attended Dumbledore's funeral, with a miserable expression on his face and twirling his green bowler. Harry had wondered whether any of the Ministry officials who showed up were genuinely saddened by Dumbledore's death, or simply putting up a facade.

<p>Initially, Fudge treated Harry Potter like a favourite nephew, and gave him lenience when the underage wizard accidentally inflated his aunt <a href="/wiki/Marjorie_Dursley" title="Marjorie Dursley">Marge</a> from his anger, rather than expel him, despite a previous offence (which was actually <a href="/wiki/Dobby" title="Dobby">Dobby</a>'s doing). This was partly due to the <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> <a href="/wiki/Azkaban_escapes#1993" title="Azkaban escapes">escapee</a> <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, who Fudge believed to be seeking to return to Voldemort; however, in a misguided attempt to protect Harry, Fudge was too reluctant to tell the boy about Black's supposed goals, as well as Harry's importance as Black's godson. In addition, Fudge refused to listen to Harry and Hermione's attempts to explain Sirius' innocence, instead going with <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>'s suggestion that they might have been <a href="/wiki/Confundus_Charm" title="Confundus Charm">confunded</a>. Harry initially thought fairly well of Fudge, regarding him as a somewhat blustering and pompous, but essentially good-natured person.<sup id="cite_ref-POA21_32-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA21-32">&#91;32&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>This kindly relationship continued until the end of the <a href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, when Harry brought back <a href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a>'s corpse and explained Voldemort's return to Dumbledore. Fudge, in fear that this would jeopardise the peace of his community and his seat as Minister for Magic, refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore, and spread a smear campaign to make it look like they were liars and nutters who were trying to gain attention, as well as take over the Ministry; his decision had partly been influenced by Rita Skeeter's writings, believing Harry to be hallucinating and that being a Parselmouth made him even more untrustworthy. Because of this, Fudge transformed Harry's disciplinary hearing of underage magic used to defend against Dementors into a heavily biased full-court trial, made the <i>Daily Prophet</i> print slander stories against him as though he was something of a slip-in joke, and granted Umbridge many new privileges to extensively punish and torment the boy. One of Fudge's ultimate goals was to expel Potter from Hogwarts and oust him from the magical community as an untrustworthy troublemaker.
</p><p>At first, Harry was shocked by Fudge's blatant denial, and somewhat desperate in regaining recognition during the trial, which did not occur, while, in extension, trying to persuade his right-hand woman Umbridge. However, as Fudge's antagonism continued, Harry lost faith in the Minister, and began to feel more disgusted at Fudge's increasingly tyrannical hold; Harry only felt more angry when Fudge chose to blame the Azkaban mass breakout on Sirius instead of accepting that Voldemort had returned. When Fudge came to Hogwarts to deal with the Dumbledore's Army business, he sneered at the captured Harry, who replied with the dirtiest look he could muster, and thought it was worth watching Fudge's blood pressure rise from anger by denying his transgression of <a href="/wiki/Educational_Decree_Number_Twenty-Four" title="Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four">Educational Decree Number Twenty-Four</a>.
</p><p>When undeniable evidence of Voldemort's return was finally given, Fudge, in a last ditch effort to remain in office, tried to persuade Harry to lie to the wizarding world (which ironically was what he had accused Harry of for a whole year) that the Ministry was doing a good job in security. This failed, as Harry hated Fudge for his actions and held him in contempt; when Harry was notified of Fudge's attempt to even ask him for such a feat, Harry expressed disgust at the former Minister's shamelessness.

<p>Dolores Umbridge was Fudge's right-hand woman, being his Senior-Undersecretary, and he trusted her greatly to place her into Hogwarts to control it. He granted her many powers through his <a href="/wiki/Educational_Decree" title="Educational Decree">Educational Decrees</a>, and full-heartedly agreed with all of her comments and mockeries against Dumbledore and Harry. It is unclear whether Fudge knew the extent of Umbridge's sadistic and dark nature, but Umbridge was loyal to Fudge only because of the power he was offering her, and felt no true attachments to the misguided man. She was also willing to break the law behind the Minister's back to achieve results, such as summoning <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> in an attempt to expel Harry, as well as using the illegal <a href="/wiki/Cruciatus_Curse" title="Cruciatus Curse">Cruciatus Curse</a> for interrogation, all the while stating that "what Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him". Curiously, however, in spite of believing Fudge would draw a line there, and in spite of Umbridge often and unfairly receiving far more blame (mostly from Hogwarts) than Fudge for everything that happened that year, both of them were immoral in very similar ways. Still, Umbridge ultimately used Fudge to further her lust for power, making him think she was a mindless extension of his own hunger. When Fudge was dismissed, Umbridge stood beside the new Ministers instead.

<p>Fudge had a close professional association with Lucius Malfoy who was a wealthy and respectable <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood" title="Pure-blood">pure-blood</a>. (Lucius was cleared in 1981 of serving Lord Voldemort, claiming to have been under the <a href="/wiki/Imperius_Curse" title="Imperius Curse">Imperius Curse</a>, which Fudge believed absolutely.) This association may have encouraged Fudge's own belief in the superiority of pure-bloods over those with mixed parentage, as well as "half-breeds" and creatures with "near-human intelligence" which his senior assistant, Umbridge, expressed. Fudge admired Lucius for giving donations of gold to the right causes. In return, Fudge granted him many privileges, such as personal access to him, favours in delaying laws and revealing classified information (e.g. the Triwizard Tournament). Fudge gave Lucius tickets to sit in the top box for the <a href="/wiki/Quidditch_World_Cup" title="Quidditch World Cup">Quidditch World Cup</a> final after his generous gift to <a href="/wiki/St_Mungo%27s_Hospital_for_Magical_Maladies_and_Injuries" title="St Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries">St Mungo's</a>. Fudge first met <a href="/wiki/Narcissa_Malfoy" title="Narcissa Malfoy">Narcissa Malfoy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco</a> there in the top box, which suggests the Malfoys and Fudges did not meet socially prior to that. Despite receiving the Minister's favours, Lucius caused him great embarrassment by secretly leading the unconvicted Death Eaters and anti-Muggle supporters in a riot that night.

<p>Fudge did have disagreements with Lucius and his views. For instance, Fudge did not oppose Arthur Weasley's <a href="/wiki/Muggle_Protection_Act" title="Muggle Protection Act">Muggle Protection Act</a>, and allowed Ministry officials to conduct raids on wizard homes (later including Lucius'), searching for artefacts harmful to Muggles. This may have turned Lucius back to the Dark Arts as his plot to re-open the <a href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a> and discredit Arthur Weasley came about when he did not get his way. Then, when the twelve school governors <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Suspension" title="Order of Suspension">suspended</a> Dumbledore for not being able to prevent the Chamber of Secrets incident, Fudge said it was the wrong thing to do, but did not use the law to interfere with the running of Hogwarts as he would later.
</p><p>After Harry survived Voldemort's rebirth and reported to him that Lucius was one of the <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> who came to the re-gathering after receiving the Dark Mark invitation, Fudge took this as a great personal offence, and absolutely refused to believe it, continuing to treat Lucius with great respect and meeting him at the Ministry. He said Harry was just throwing out names of people who were cleared thirteen years previously, and began a campaign to discredit Harry and Dumbledore. The next year, when Lucius' son, Draco Malfoy, captured Harry for being in the illegal organisation calling itself <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>, Fudge commented that his father must be informed of this achievement. Fudge was completely oblivious to Lucius' dark nature. Lucius, in turn, used this to his advantage and manipulated the gullible Minister to delay laws and other factors that would benefit the Death Eaters. By the time Lucius was caught red-handed as a renewed Death Eater, Lord Voldemort had a year to regain power and followers while being unopposed by the Ministry, making it that much harder for his successor to protect the <a href="/wiki/Wizarding_world" title="Wizarding world">wizarding world</a>, even with Lucius being locked up in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>. As a result, Fudge suffered almost exactly the same consequences as Lucius: both lost their positions of influence, while desperately and unsuccessfully trying to reclaim it.

<p>As Arthur was a lower-class person and having a poor family, Fudge always neglected Arthur while having a manipulated friendship with his wealthy rival, Lucius Malfoy, due to Fudge's swaying of money and power. As Arthur was considered an odd duck due to his fascination with Muggle culture, Fudge was able to use that as an excuse that Mr Weasley "did not fit" into the Ministry norm and that he was unfit for promotion to higher office. However, despite his disapproval and neglect of Arthur, Fudge did not oppose Arthur's Muggle Protection Act as he was also accepting towards Muggles, and once allowed Arthur and his family to sit at the Top Box during the Quiddich World Cup. When Lord Voldemort had returned, Fudge suspected Arthur being in league with Dumbledore since he was aware that the two of them were friendly. He even invited Arthur's son, Percy to become his Junior Assistant in an attempt to spy on the Weasley family and Dumbledore, which led to Percy defecting from his family after a row with Arthur. Fudge ignored Arthur and Harry's existences when he and the Wizengamot exited Courtroom Ten. After Fudge was disgraced and forced to resign, Arthur was instantly promoted by Fudge's successor.

<p>Percy Weasley and <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">his family</a> were originally looked down on by Fudge, due to their lack of wealth and having more affiliation with Muggles.
</p><p>However, in 1995, Fudge promoted Percy to become his Junior Minister. This was an attempt to spy on the <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley family</a>, but Percy's defection from his family made it pointless. However, Percy commented in his <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley%27s_letter_to_Ronald_Weasley_(1995)_II" title="Percy Weasley&#39;s letter to Ronald Weasley (1995) II">letter</a> to his younger brother <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a> that the Minister would not be more gracious to him for this defection, and he agreed with Fudge on that Harry was violent and disturbed and Dumbledore is plotting to overthrow Fudge when the Ministry began publishing articles, leading to a quarrel with his family. By Percy's claim, Fudge was actually glad that Percy left his family for the sake of the Ministry. This may have been a contradiction as this meant Percy was no longer a source of information of the Weasley family's involvement with Dumbledore and Potter. Over the final year of Fudge's term as Minister, he kept using Percy as the court scribe for both <a href="/wiki/Disciplinary_hearing_of_Harry_Potter" title="Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter">Harry's disciplinary hearing</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army#Discovery" title="Dumbledore&#39;s Army">discovery of Dumbledore's Army</a>. Percy, during both moments, heartily agreed with Fudge's decisions, and laughed when Fudge made insulting mockeries at Harry and Dumbledore. When Fudge's folly had been exposed and he was forced to resign as Minister in disgrace, Percy remained loyal to the Ministry, but did not show any sympathy for or against Fudge's dismissal.

<p>Fudge had a huge hatred for <a href="/wiki/Bartemius_Crouch_Senior" title="Bartemius Crouch Senior">Barty Crouch Snr</a>. This was because of Barty being one of his main competitors during the election for Minister of Magic in 1990, where he was jealous of how much Crouch was admired in the Ministry Despite winning, the election left Fudge with such a strong dislike of Crouch, so much that, Fudge's first act as Minister of Magic was to have Crouch reassigned to the Department of International Magical Cooperation, using Crouch's falling popularity after Crouch's son's trial to his advantage. Fudge's dislike of Crouch was strong to the point where he refused to take Crouch seriously when Crouch vanished after trying to warn Dumbledore about his son and Voldemort despite being in a delusional state, Fudge simply dismissed his warnings as the ramblings of a lunatic, and refused to believe the real reason he was gone until he was forced to acknowledge Voldemort's return the following year. This dislike also extended to Crouch's son, as he believed Crouch Jnr was not a true Death Eater and that he only acted through insanity rather than his loyalty to Voldemort, calling him as a lunatic just like his father, and had no regret about Crouch Jnr receiving the Dementors Kiss and therefore ending the Crouch family line, even though Crouch Jnr could no longer testify Voldemort's return as a result. Despite his dislike of Crouch Snr, Fudge apparently required Crouch for translating foreign wizards and creatures who didn't understand English, as he struggled to communicate with the Bulgarian Minister of Magic (who was pretending to not understand English in order to prank Fudge) during the Quiddich World Cup while Crouch was absent. It is unknown what Crouch thought of Fudge, although given his serious and rule abiding nature, he likely disliked Fudge in turn for his bumbling and incompetent nature, and for reassigning him to the Department of International Magical Cooperation, which permanently ruined any further chances of Crouch becoming Minister of Magic despite his fall in popularity.

<dd></dd></dl></div>
<p>When Fudge first ascended his ranks to the Minister for Magic, his bumbling nature failed to worry the citizens, as long as he was willing to take advice from more able people such as Albus Dumbledore. However, Fudge never forgot how much the community supported Dumbledore to become the Minister in the past. As his position was the leader of the entire government, he was nevertheless highly influenced and affected by the opinion of the people as a whole. When a few people would oppose his rule which threatened his administration, he would abuse his powers to discredit such people to maintain his hold on the likings of the rest of them, as well as threatening any employees with dismissal for not supporting his rule; ironically, Fudge only became popular because he took Dumbledore's advice to begin with. When Fudge awarded himself with the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Merlin" title="Order of Merlin">Order of Merlin</a>, First Class medal, it caused controversies throughout the community, as it was common view that Fudge's career was "less than distinguished".<sup id="cite_ref-PMordermerlin_18-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PMordermerlin-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>However, by ignoring Dumbledore's and Potter's warning of Voldemort's return, Fudge endangered the entire world, and despite his increasingly tyrannical hold on them, about half of the British wizard community chose to believe Dumbledore and Potter instead. When undeniable evidence of the truth finally came out, the entire community issued a virtually unanimous condemnation of Fudge's tenure, while Fudge made one last (unsuccessful) attempt to lie to them to regain their trust, which would have further endangered them by denying more preparation. Fudge was ultimately forced to resign after two weeks of pressure, and was remembered by history, as Dumbledore had warned him, "<i>as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild</i>".

<p>As with the majority of the wizarding world, Fudge deeply feared <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a>, to the point of being unable to say his name aloud, using the evasive alternatives or writing it out. Fudge preferred the peace and tranquillity that came with Voldemort's first downfall that he refused to spoil it as long as there is insufficient evidence of his return. His fear and self-denial led him to campaign to discredit those who tried to say Voldemort is back, instead of making preparations of ensuring their victory and safety in the upcoming war. Cornelius continuously sought excuses of the increasing disappearances and the Azkaban mass breakout instead of accepting the fact that the most evil Dark Wizard has came back. Only when seeing Voldemort in the flesh did Fudge accept the Dark Lord's return. Voldemort was able to take full advantage of Cornelius' besotted moves to rebuild his forces with no interference, and by the time the truth came out, it was too late for the disgraced Minister to defend the community. Despite his fear, Cornelius refused to stand aside when Voldemort threatened him with a mass murder of Muggles.

<ul><li><b>Cornelius</b> is an old Roman clan's name, possibly related to the Latin word <i>cornu</i> (horn). Name of early Christian saints with a mediaeval cult in the Low Countries.</li>
<li><b>Oswald</b> is of old Germanic origin, and means "godly rule" or "power of a god" (from Anglo-Saxon <i>ós</i>, which means "god" in a polytheistic context, and <i>weald</i>, "rule"). This is a reference of Fudge's political power amongst the British wizarding world is the highest, to the point of god-like. The name Oswald has had negative connotations since the 1930s due to British Fascist leader <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Mosley" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Oswald Mosley">Sir Oswald Mosley</a> - and ally of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> - as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Lee Harvey Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> - assassin of U.S. President John F. Kennedy - since the 1960s. Both can allude to Fudge's negative impact upon the wizarding world, the former due to his blood purity and social elitism, as exemplified by his favouritism of Lucius Malfoy, and the latter due to his attempt to assassinate Dumbledore's reputation.</li>
<li><b>Fudge</b> (Verb) To alter something from its true state, as to hide a flaw or uncertainty. Always deliberate, but not necessarily dishonest or immoral.
<ul><li>(intransitive) To try to avoid giving a direct answer; to waffle or equivocate.</li>
<li>"<i>Fudge</i>", besides being a toffee-like confection (though softer, and crumbly rather than chewy), can mean "nonsense". This meaning originated from (probably 18th-century) sailors;<sup id="cite_ref-snark_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-snark-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> it was derived from a merchant-Captain Fudge, who was renowned as a teller of tall tales. As a verb, it means to "evade" or to "falsify". In technological jargon, it means "to perform in an incomplete but marginally acceptable way."</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li>Fudge was portrayed in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_films" class="mw-redirect" title="Harry Potter films"><i>Harry Potter</i> films</a> by the late <a href="/wiki/Robert_Hardy" title="Robert Hardy">Robert Hardy</a>. He appeared in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Chamber_of_Secrets_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)">Chamber of Secrets</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">Order of the Phoenix</a></i>. However, his appearance in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)">Goblet of Fire</a></i> is very brief, and his voice is heard and he is not visible at any point in <i>Half-Blood Prince</i>.</li>
<li>He was voiced by <a href="/wiki/Dov_Reiser" title="Dov Reiser">Dov Reiser</a> in a dub of the fifth video game.</li>
<li>He also sports a hairstyle unusual for the time period in the 2nd film.</li>
<li>While Fudge avoids using Voldemort's name throughout the series, to the point of being rude to the Muggle Prime Minister when he began to read it aloud, Fudge calls him "Lord Voldemort" in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire" title="Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire">fourth book</a>.</li>
<li>The <i>Goblet of Fire</i> film omits Fudge ordering the Dementor's Kiss on Barty Crouch Jnr, and the beginning of his doubt of Dumbledore and Harry. The latter part is covered in the following film.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, Fudge's removal from office via resignation is revealed. In the books Fudge's removal, a sacking, was revealed in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>.</li>
<li>Also in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, Fudge didn't seem as antagonistic towards Harry and Dumbledore as he was in the book, though this was simply because he was not given much screen-time in comparison to the novel or possibly because in the films, antagonism between some characters is reduced to being less obnoxious than in the novels.</li>
<li>Several comparisons have been made between Fudge and real-life <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">British</a> Prime Minister <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neville_Chamberlain" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Neville Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> (who also shares a first name with Neville Longbottom), who gave in to Adolf Hitler at the Munich Conference and foolishly announced "peace in our time" in <a href="/wiki/1938" title="1938">1938</a>, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Despite any of his other accomplishments, he has largely had a historical reputation as a bumbler.</li>
<li>Fudge's actions at the end of <i>Goblet of Fire</i> and throughout <i>Order of the Phoenix</i> are also similar to American business and media mogul-turned president <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Donald Trump">Donald Trump</a> during the COVID-19 Pandemic as both men were in denial about the respective threats, refused to accept the truth, lied about them, spiralled into corruption, were responsible for lots deaths and tried to stay in power. However, Trump lost his re-election for a second term, believes he saved more lives and is refusing to concede to President-Elect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Joe Biden">Joe Biden</a>, despite his administration making the transition, while Fudge eventually accepted that he failed his community and resigned in disgrace.</li>
<li>Fudge entered office in <a href="/wiki/1990" title="1990">1990</a>, the same year as real-life British Prime Minister <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Major" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:John Major">Sir John Major</a>.</li>
<li>Fudge, who became Minister in the year above, states to the <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> <a href="/wiki/British_Prime_Minister_in_1996" title="British Prime Minister in 1996">Prime Minister</a> that his predecessor was worse at accepting the wizarding world than him (the predecessor tried to throw Fudge out the window, thinking he was a hoax). It is likely that either Fudge used to work in the capacity of advisor to the Prime Minister and Minister for Magic prior to 1990, or this particular Prime Minister was only in office for at least two years, which would have been a rather sudden change in the Muggle government.</li>
<li>Ironically, Hardy was well known for playing Chamberlain's successor, Winston Churchill, in a series of television miniseries.</li>
<li>Fudge's wand in the films has a striking resemblance to <a href="/wiki/Filius_Flitwick%27s_wand" title="Filius Flitwick&#39;s wand">Filius Flitwick's wand</a>.</li>
<li>While Fudge disagrees with Dumbledore and Harry, they were actually trying to help him with his career (albeit indirectly) by announcing Voldemort's return. In contrast, the people Fudge is friendly with, Lucius and Umbridge, are merely using him to help with their own personal agendas and have no true attachments to him.</li>
<li>It is always mentioned in the books that Fudge sports a lime green bowler hat. However, in the films, Fudge is shown wearing a black bowler hat. He is also not as short as Fudge is described to be in the books.</li>
<li>Fudge is described in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i> with a gold pocket watch, yet in the films he is shown with a <a href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge%27s_pocket_watch" title="Cornelius Fudge&#39;s pocket watch">silver pocket watch</a>.</li>
<li>There was a real person named Cornelius Fudge, who was a naval captain on the H.M.S. London in the <a href="/wiki/19th_century" title="19th century">19th century</a>. However, J. K. Rowling has denied basing Minister Fudge's name off of this person or any other real personage, saying as much in a letter to John Jeffries, the owner of a narwhal tusk that had been engraved to the real Fudge. Despite the two characters not having any link, Jeffries gave a small portion of the proceeds from the auction of the tusk to a multiple sclerosis charity, a cause with personal importance to Rowling.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>A very early draft of J.K. Rowling's first <i>Harry Potter</i> novel – which is on display at the British Library's Harry Potter: A History of Magic exhibition – reveals that the author had originally depicted Fudge as a Muggle politician who met with the wizarding world's envoy, Rubeus Hagrid, to discuss a series of mysterious deaths and vanishings. In the original version, Hagrid attributed these deeds to a villain who he refused to name and begged Fudge to warn the public about the mysterious threat. A stunned Fudge thought about the strange encounter for a while and then called a press conference to warn Muggles about a "little man with red eyes" and urged them to "be careful not to tell this little man where anyone lived". The Muggle version of Fudge also had a connection to a very important character in the Harry Potter novels: Vernon Dursley. Vernon was originally one of the Muggle Minister's enemies, who Fudge feared would be after his job now that he was "clearly nuttier than a bag of salted peanuts". But rather than attempt to oust him, Mr Dursley actually came to chat with Fudge about the wizarding world and his nephew, who'd been placed in his care following the death of his parents. This draft can now be read in the book <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter:_A_Journey_Through_a_History_of_Magic" title="Harry Potter: A Journey Through a History of Magic">Harry Potter: A Journey Through a History of Magic</a></i>. It was later re-purposed for "The Other Minister," the first chapter of <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i>.</li>
<li>In the film adaptation of Order of the Phoenix, a banner of Fudge is shown in the Ministry Atrium and it depicts the Minister in the style of 1930s posters from the former Soviet Union. During Dumbledore and Voldemort's duel, the broken shards of glass tear the Banner apart, foreshadowing Fudge's term as minister ending in disgrace.</li></ul>
