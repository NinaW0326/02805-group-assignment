<p>However, around <a href="/wiki/1608" class="mw-redirect" title="1608">1608</a> when Sayre was five years old, her family's cottage was attacked and set on <a href="/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a>.

This incident marked the&#160;beginning of a harsh&#160;existence that Isolt would have to endure for many years to come. Gaunt took Sayre to the neighbouring valley of <a href="/wiki/Coomcallee" title="Coomcallee">Coomcallee</a>, where she raised her, using powerful <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">Dark magic</a> to enforce her cooperation and isolation.

<p>Gaunt proved to be an unstable and cruel guardian. A <a href="/wiki/Pure-blood_supremacy" title="Pure-blood supremacy">pure-blood supremacist</a>, she believed that her sister's willingness to help Muggles would lead to what she believed to be a "dangerous path" to marrying a Muggle man. As she grew older, Sayre realised that her aunt had kidnapped her and set her house ablaze, and was therefore her parents' murderer. Gaunt would make Sayre watch as she <a href="/wiki/Curse" title="Curse">cursed</a> or <a href="/wiki/Jinx" title="Jinx">jinxed</a> any Muggle or animal that got too close to her cottage. The village learned to keep their distance from the cottage, and the only outside contact Sayre would get with anyone but her aunt was when local village boys threw stones at her when she played in the garden.
</p><p>When Sayre turned eleven around <a href="/wiki/1614" class="mw-redirect" title="1614">1614</a> her <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_acceptance_letter" title="Hogwarts acceptance letter">Hogwarts acceptance letter</a> arrived.

Gaunt herself had attended Hogwarts where she was sorted into <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>, and told Sayre much about it, but largely denigrated it, lamenting that <a href="/wiki/Salazar_Slytherin" title="Salazar Slytherin">Salazar Slytherin</a>'s plans for the purity of <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizardkind</a> had been unfulfilled. This, however, led Sayre, who had been isolated and mistreated by her aunt for years, to believe Hogwarts to be a sort of paradise and she spent much of her time as a teenager fantasising about it.<sup id="cite_ref-Pottermore_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pottermore-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

She stole her aunt's wand, and left the cottage and fled the country. The only other object she took with her was a gold brooch in the shape of a <a href="/wiki/Gordian_Knot" title="Gordian Knot">Gordian Knot</a> that had belonged to her mother. Fearing her aunt's prodigious tracking abilities and her subsequent punishment, Sayre fled to England, but soon her aunt was on her tail. Determined to hide from her cruel aunt, she cut off all her hair and, for five years, pretended to be a Muggle boy, taking on the name of "Elias Story" (an anagram of "Isolt Sayre"), all the while her aunt was attempting to track her. She then went aboard the <i><a href="/wiki/Mayflower" title="Mayflower">Mayflower</a></i> in <a href="/wiki/1620" class="mw-redirect" title="1620">1620</a> and sailed to <a href="/wiki/North_America" title="North America">North America</a>.
</p><p>Sayre arrived in America as one of the earliest European settlers, most of them Muggles. Soon after arriving, Sayre left and moved to the surrounding mountains, leaving the Muggle settlers to assume that "Elias Story" was killed during the harsh winter among the others. Sayre left partly due to her belief that, despite moving to an entirely new continent, her wicked aunt would still somehow track her down. The other reason was that her voyage aboard the <i>Mayflower</i> led her to the conclusion that the Puritans there would be unlikely to accept her, as Sayre was a witch.
</p><p>After several weeks of living alone in the mountains in complete isolation, Sayre came across a <a href="/wiki/Hidebehind" title="Hidebehind">Hidebehind</a> about to disembowel a <a href="/wiki/Pukwudgie" title="Pukwudgie">Pukwudgie</a>. She cast a curse, making the Hidebehind flee. Unaware that Pukwudgies were rather dangerous to humans, Sayre carried him to her makeshift shelter and nursed him back to health. The Pukwudgie declared himself bound to her until he had the opportunity to repay his debt, but was greatly humiliated to be indebted to a young, vulnerable girl. Sayre handled the Pukwudgie's ingratitude and found him amusing and was glad of the company. Over time, however, a friendship formed between the two. Faithful to the beliefs of his race, the Pukwudgie refused to tell Sayre his real name, so she named him "<a href="/wiki/William_(Pukwudgie)" title="William (Pukwudgie)">William</a>" after her deceased father.<sup id="cite_ref-Pottermore_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pottermore-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

Because this was alarming to William, she did not talk about her sense of kinship with the serpent, and that it seemed to tell her things.

<p>One day, while foraging in the woods, the two heard a grisly noise nearby. William shouted at Isolt to stay put and, poisoned arrow at the ready, charged through the trees towards the noise. Isolt ignored the directions and followed William to find that the Hidebehind who had attempted to kill William years ago had killed two naïve humans and was preparing to disembowel them, and two boys lay seriously injured nearby.

<p>The Steward family had no idea that word of Ilvermorny had reached Gormlaith Gaunt, Isolt's aunt who she had managed to escaped from a year prior. When she learned of this, she made her way to America. Gormlaith vowed to kill Isolt and James, destroy the school building, and kidnap their daughters. As soon as she saw the house, she cast a sleeping curse on the couple, placing them into an enchanted slumber. Chadwick, having spotted Gormlaith outside, sent Webster to awaken James and Isolt. This&#160;was unsuccessful due to the powerful curse, so he went outside to help Chadwick duel Gormlaith. This was the only option, as they were the only ones awake.

<p>Due to the commotion, Martha and Rionach were woken up, and due to the power of love, their cries broke through the enchantment laid upon Isolt and James. Isolt woke up to the noise around her and screamed at James to go get their daughters, while she ran outside to assist her sons in duelling Gormlaith. Once she raised the stolen wand to attack, it did not, as Gormlaith had activated a hidden spell that would disable&#160;it. A gloating Gormlaith chased and drove the three back up the stairs, to the room where she could hear crying.
</p><p>Isolt followed Gormlaith up to the room where James and their daughters were. Certain that "all was lost", Isolt, hardly thinking, cried out her father's name. There was a clatter as Isolt witnessed William the Pukwudgie appear and a poison-tipped arrow pierced Gormlaith in the heart, killing her. The family expressed their extreme gratitude. However, William was upset that it had taken Isolt ten years to say his name again. Isolt chose not to mention that she was actually calling for her late father. William later moved in with Isolt and her family at Ilvermorny.<sup id="cite_ref-Pottermore_1-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Pottermore-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Isolt was unable to speak <a href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">Parseltongue</a> to undo the spell on the wand to reactivate it, so she and James buried it in the school grounds. She did not wish to keep the wand, anyway, as it was the last reminder of her unhappy childhood. Within a year, a snakewood tree grew from the ground where it was buried. Any attempts to kill or prune it was unsuccessful, and it was kept after it was discovered that the tree contained powerful medicinal properties.
</p><p>As Ilvermorny’s reputation grew steadily throughout the following years, Isolt and James remained joint Headmaster and Headmistress.

<p>Isolt was noted to be close to nature, having a talent and passion for the outdoors and the natural world. Despite her harsh upbringing by her twisted aunt, Isolt possessed a powerful ability to love. Her ability to love so purely and unconditional that it led to the eventual creation of her school. Isolt was a loving wife to her <a href="/wiki/Muggle" class="mw-redirect" title="Muggle">No-Maj</a> husband, James and a caring mother to all four of her children, both adopted and biological. She was also a loyal friend to the Pukwudgie (William) who in turn saved the lives of her and her family. Isolt also cared nothing for her aunt and ancestor's pure-blood fanaticism.
</p><p>Isolt possessed a tremendous passion for learning and together she and her husband presided over their school. Together they helped to structure and expand the knowledge of magic in North America, and combined knowledge from the continent with that of European sorcery to create something new, beautiful, and powerful. This passion for learning and education of Isolt's was passed into her patron House at Ilvermorny, the <a href="/wiki/Horned_Serpent" title="Horned Serpent">Horned Serpent</a>, the house of scholars.

<ul><li>Isolt is a variant of the name <i>Isolde</i>, whose origins are uncertain, though some Celtic roots have been suggested. It is possible that the name is ultimately Germanic, perhaps from a hypothetic name like Ishild, composed of the elements is "ice, iron" and hild "battle". In medieval Arthurian legend Isolde was an Irish princess betrothed to King Mark of Cornwall. After accidentally drinking a love potion, she became the lover of his knight Tristan, which led to their tragic deaths.</li>
<li>Sayre is a derivative of the pre-medieval personal name <i>Saher</i> or <i>Seir</i>, which itself is a short form of the Norman name <i>Sigiheri</i> introduced into England after the Conquest of 1066, and that can be translated as "victory, army". It can also be originated from the medieval occupational name for a wood cutter, <i>sayhare</i>, although the usual surname is now <i>Sawyer</i>. The third orgin is from Middle English <i>say(en)</i> or <i>seycen</i>, to say, and literally means "professional reciter".The fourth origin is from the medieval occupation of assaying metals or tasting food, derived from the Old French <i>essay</i>, meaning "trial, test".</li></ul>
