<p>Remus was born on <a href="/wiki/10_March" title="10 March">10 March</a>, <a href="/wiki/1960" title="1960">1960</a> to <a href="/wiki/Lyall_Lupin" title="Lyall Lupin">Lyall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hope_Howell" title="Hope Howell">Hope Lupin</a>. His father worked at the Ministry of Magic and encountered the werewolf <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Fenrir Greyback</a>, who was on trial for killing two children. Lyall was the only one at court to realise that Greyback was a werewolf, as Greyback pretended to be a <a href="/wiki/Non-magic_people" title="Non-magic people">Muggle</a> tramp. Outraged when Greyback was released, he voiced the opinion that Greyback deserved nothing but death. This opinion cost the Lupin family dearly, as Greyback decided to revenge himself upon Lyall by targeting his son. As the nearly five-year-old Remus slept peacefully in his bed, Greyback forced his way in through the window. Though Lyall was able to get there in time to drive Greyback off with powerful spells, he was unable to prevent him from completing his evil goal. Remus became infected with <a href="/wiki/Lycanthropy" title="Lycanthropy">lycanthropy</a> and he became a werewolf himself.<sup id="cite_ref-PM_1-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Remus attended Hogwarts and was Sorted into <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor House</a>. To secure his safety, as well as that of his peers, Remus would be brought to the <a href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a> once a month for his transformations in order to prevent him from attacking other students. However, this isolation caused him to attack himself out of frustration. This, and the painful monthly transformations, made the villagers of <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> mistake his screams for that of violent <a href="/wiki/Ghost" title="Ghost">ghosts</a>. Dumbledore, wanting to keep the truth of these noises a secret, encouraged these rumours. Thus, the building was dubbed the Shrieking Shack, which held the reputation for being the most haunted building in Britain.<sup id="cite_ref-POA18_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA18-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Remus became the very best of friends with fellow Gryffindors <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a>. He kept his status as a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> a secret from all of the students at Hogwarts, including Sirius, James, and Peter, his fellow Marauders and future Order members. He made up stories to explain his monthly disappearances, such as that his mother was ill and he needed to go home to visit her. He was terrified that they would desert him once they found out what he truly was. However, Sirius, James, and Peter worked out the truth during their second year, and due to their acceptance of who Remus was, and their unusually strong friendship with him, they decided to learn how to become <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagi</a> in order to keep Remus company during his transformations, as a werewolf is only a danger to humans.<sup id="cite_ref-POA18_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA18-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>

<p>By their fifth year, Sirius was able to become a <a href="/wiki/Dog" title="Dog">dog</a>, and James was able to become a <a href="/wiki/Deer" title="Deer">stag</a>, animals large enough to keep the wolfish Remus in check. Peter, meanwhile, was able to become a <a href="/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rat</a>. Once a month during the full moon, Sirius, James and Peter would sneak out of the castle under James' <a href="/wiki/Cloak_of_Invisibility" title="Cloak of Invisibility">Invisibility Cloak</a>, transform, get into the <a href="/wiki/Whomping_Willow" title="Whomping Willow">Whomping Willow</a>, walk down the tunnel and meet up with Remus in the Shrieking Shack. Under their influence, Lupin became tame; his body was still a wolf's, but his mind became less so when he was among them. The four of them soon left the Whomping Willow and would roam among the school grounds and <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> by night. Eventually, this group of friends came to call themselves the Marauders, and Remus' friends nicknamed him "Moony" because of his transformations during every full <a href="/wiki/Moon" title="Moon">moon</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-POA_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Remus was a good student, but also a prankster. He and Peter Pettigrew would sometimes join Sirius and James in detention for mischief-making, though they did not get into as much trouble as their other friends. It's unlikely that any other Hogwarts students ever found out as much about the Hogwarts grounds and <a href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a> as they did and Sirius, James, Remus and Peter used their knowledge of it to write the <a href="/wiki/Marauder%27s_Map" title="Marauder&#39;s Map">Marauder's Map</a> and signed it with their nicknames.<sup id="cite_ref-POA18_10-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA18-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> Unfortunately, it somehow ended up being confiscated by <a href="/wiki/Argus_Filch" title="Argus Filch">Argus Filch</a>, but was eventually recovered by <a href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley" title="Fred Weasley">Fred</a> and <a href="/wiki/George_Weasley" title="George Weasley">George Weasley</a> in the 1989-90 school year.<sup id="cite_ref-POA10_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA10-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup>

Because of Severus' enmity towards Sirius and James, he disliked Remus and Peter by association, making him all the more suspicious.

</p><p>Sometime in their fifth-year<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>, Sirius played a malicious prank on Snape by telling him about the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Whomping_Willow" title="Hogwarts Whomping Willow">Whomping Willow</a> passageway, hoping that he would be terrified or even get seriously hurt by what he found at the other end. James, who hated Snape, was able to stop Snape and save his life in the nick of time, but Snape still uncovered Remus' secret, seeing him at the end of the passage.

He claimed Albus Dumbledore had hoped he could exert control over them as a Prefect. Sirius later told Harry that Remus wasn't an idiot like his friends because he was never cruel to Snape.

<p>Shortly after graduating from Hogwarts, Remus joined the Order of the Phoenix along with Sirius, <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Lily_J._Potter" title="Lily J. Potter">Lily Evans</a>, standing up against <a href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle" title="Tom Riddle">Lord Voldemort</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. Remus failed to find employment following his education because of his affliction as a werewolf. However, James used his wealth to financially support him.<sup id="cite_ref-CarnegieHall_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CarnegieHall-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>By the height of the war, Remus' friend <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a> had come to distrust him, suspecting that he might be a spy for the other side. Thus, when a <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney%27s_first_prophecy" title="Sybill Trelawney&#39;s first prophecy">prophecy</a> was made about a child who would have the power to defeat the Dark Lord, and Dumbledore identified infant <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> as a possible target, Remus was not included in the plan to keep the <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">Potters</a> safe, though he was aware that they used the <a href="/wiki/Fidelius_Charm" title="Fidelius Charm">Fidelius Charm</a>. James and Lily Potter wanted to use Sirius as their <a href="/wiki/Secret-Keeper" class="mw-redirect" title="Secret-Keeper">Secret-Keeper</a>, but Sirius thought that would be too obvious, and thus suggested Peter Pettigrew instead, who would be a nearly unpredictable move, him being known for his "<i>measly empty-headedness</i>." Neither Dumbledore or Lupin knew of this switch.<sup id="cite_ref-POA_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>At the time of Lily and James' death, Lupin was in the north of the country on <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> business when he discovered what had, apparently, happened. This was one of the most traumatic events of Remus' life, especially since, within the next day, he would also be losing his other two best friends. Sirius was imprisoned in <a href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> for supposedly murdering Pettigrew and twelve Muggles with one <a href="/wiki/Blasting_Curse" title="Blasting Curse">curse</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-PM_1-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>After Voldemort's first downfall, the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> disbanded, and members returned to their busy lives with their families. Lupin, however, was left lonely and unhappy — two of his three best friends were dead, one was imprisoned for mass murder, his mother had eventually died too, and he refused to spoil his father's peaceful existence by returning to live with him. Remus was forced to take jobs that were far below his level of ability, always knowing he would have to leave them before his workmates noticed the signs of his lycanthropy. A faint ray of hope came for Remus when he heard of the new invention of the <a href="/wiki/Wolfsbane_Potion" title="Wolfsbane Potion">Wolfsbane Potion</a>, which can mitigate the worst effects of lycanthropy, though this was almost immediately dashed when he saw the potion's complexity and expensive ingredients. Potions was not his strongest suit and he has a very low income rate.

<p>Remus was soon summoned to Snape's office to identify whether a piece of parchment he caught Harry with to be Dark magic. Remus recognised it as the Marauder's Map but tried to pass it off as a product of <a href="/wiki/Zonko%27s_Joke_Shop" title="Zonko&#39;s Joke Shop">Zonko's Joke Shop</a>. At the same moment, Ron burst in to back up that claim. After escorting the two boys from Snape's office, Remus told them that he knew what the map was and was more astounded that they did not hand it in, and reprimanded Harry, much to their surprise. He confiscated the map, knowing that it would be too dangerous for Harry to use the secret passages with Sirius on the loose.<sup id="cite_ref-POA14_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA14-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>For his third years' end of year tests in June, he prepared an unusual exam — an obstacle course out in the grounds in which the students had to: wade across a paddling pool containing a <a href="/wiki/Grindylow" title="Grindylow">grindylow</a>; cross a series of pot-holes full of Red Caps; cross a marsh while being fed misleading directions by a hinkypunk; and enter a trunk to battle a newly procured boggart.<sup id="cite_ref-POA16_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA16-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> Hermione Granger even commented in her fifth year that Lupin's exam was the only occasion where she and Harry took a Defence exam from a teacher who knew what they were doing (exams were cancelled in second year and Harry was exempt due to his status as a Triwizard Champion in fourth year).

Mr Weasley immediately suggested that Snape was just pretending to help Malfoy, but Lupin severely pointed out that Dumbledore trusted Snape, which "ought to be good enough for all of them." Although Snape exposed Lupin as a werewolf, forcing him to resign his position at Hogwarts, he also kept him healthy by making him a special potion during his monthly transformation. Lupin neither liked nor disliked Snape – but personal feelings have nothing to do with his decision to trust him. Lupin argued strongly against making judgments based on feelings – even though he, of all people, had strong reasons to dislike Snape personally, he refused to let this affect his conclusions about the man. This pronouncement established him as a foil to <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a> and Sirius, who disliked Snape for petty reasons and treated these feelings as a justification for bullying him.

<p>Remus suffered great mental anguish as the war escalated when he learned that his wife was pregnant.

<p>Remus was described as having a pale face with premature lines, and light brown hair that, as he progressed through his thirties, became more and more grey. The lines on his face and his greying hair were the results of the great deal of stress his body underwent with each full moon. His clothing is consistently shabby and patched, presumably because of his inability to find a decently-paid job due to his status as a werewolf.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/1993" title="1993">1993</a>, he sported a thin moustache, and from <a href="/wiki/1995" title="1995">1995</a> until his death, he sported more of a rough beard. He had scars cutting across his face and given Remus' comments on werewolf inflicted injuries being cursed wounds that are unlikely to fully heal after <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Fenrir Greyback</a>'s attack on <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a>, it is possible he had more scars from his self-inflicted injuries during his transformations. In death, however, the flaws of his appearance were rectified, just like his friend <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>; his spirit was described as "<i>younger, less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker</i>."
</p><p>He was also quite tall, standing six feet, two inches tall. His height was not often mentioned, but is notable as his height corresponded roughly to the full length of a wolf's body from nose to tail. His 162 pound weight also corresponded to his wolfish dimensions. 
</p><p>In his werewolf form, he was a large beast with grey fur, and the only differences between his appearance and that of a true wolf being his shorter snout, more human eyes, and tufted tail.

<p>Remus was unusually perceptive, with an uncanny ability to guess the thoughts of those around him. This is especially clear in his conversations with <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>, such as his intuiting that Harry was afraid that he thought he couldn't handle working with the <a href="/wiki/Boggart" title="Boggart">boggart</a>. He was a gifted teacher, with a rare flair for his subject and a profound understanding of his pupils. He was, as ever, drawn to the underdog, and <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a> especially benefited from his wisdom and encouragement. His perceptive nature is a rather ironic trait, given that wolves are rather intuitive and astute judges of character and communicate primarily through body language, a skill that Remus was extremely developed and talented at.

<p>True to being a <a href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, Lupin was quite courageous. Nonetheless, he suffered deep-seated feelings of shame and fear of rejection which, in certain situations, led him to consider backing down. His greatest weakness was that, in his desperate longing to belong and be liked, he was neither as brave or honest as he should have been at times. Remus once claimed that he was cowardly, because he was unable to bring himself to tell <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> that <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Peter Pettigrew</a> were <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagi</a>, as it would have meant that he had betrayed Dumbledore's trust, which meant everything to him. His love for James and Sirius also led him to not do anything to stop their bullying other students, a most notable example being when Snape was constantly bullied by his friends, but Remus was terrified of losing them and therefore did nothing to stop the bullying, something that he later admits to regret. Perhaps the most critical example of this was his temptation to join Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> on Dumbledore's mission and abandon his wife and unborn son because he was afraid that her family would be ashamed of him being a werewolf. However, ultimately he came to his senses.
</p><p>He also was known to dislike the form of his <a href="/wiki/Patronus_Charm" title="Patronus Charm">Patronus</a> as it took the shape of a wolf. Lupin was disgusted by all things wolfish as they reminded him of his condition, and due to this has been known to deliberately cast a non-corporeal Patronus, particularly when in the company of others, for fear it would give him away as a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a>. The irony of this is that his desires to belong and be liked are that wolves are social animals, and often act in the interests of their pack, much like Remus' self-sacrificing nature, making him rather wolf-like even in his human form. In many ways, he represented the best parts of wolves, including his intelligence, adaptability, nurturing instincts, and his fierce desire to protect his loved ones.

</p><p>Remus' nurturing instincts were incredibly wolfish. Due to his position being that of a moderator, teacher, and nurturer, Remus fit the wolf pack position of the "nanny" or sergeant, looking after and teaching younger wolves - in this case his students and younger Order members, and keeping his friends in line, albeit with limited success at times.
</p><p>In contrast to Sirius' more competitive and combative nature, Remus was far more peaceful, reserved, and prone to negotiation despite his nature as a werewolf. This is symbolic of how dogs often tend to fight for dominance versus the more pragmatic and somewhat democratic nature of wolves in a pack who organise themselves peacefully unless threatened. However, Remus was by no means weak and marched into battle against Voldemort's soldiers like a true warrior. Remus referred to Voldemort by name, unafraid of the Dark Lord or his loyal Death Eaters.

When <a href="/wiki/George_Weasley" title="George Weasley">George Weasley</a>'s ear was accidentally cursed off by Severus Snape, Lupin managed to carry George to safety even though he wished to have paid Snape back in kind, showing that his concern for others was greater than his longtime feud with Snape.

The level of willpower and courage Lupin displayed throughout his life to keep fighting for what was good despite having every reason to succumb to depression was what resulted in him being posthumously awarded the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Merlin" title="Order of Merlin">Order of Merlin</a> First Class, being the first <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> in history to receive that honour.</li></ul>

<p>Remus and Tonks came to know each other as members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a> during the <a href="/wiki/Second_Wizarding_War" title="Second Wizarding War">Second Wizarding War</a>. Remus, so often melancholy and lonely, was first amused, then impressed, then seriously smitten by the witch. He had never fallen in love before. If it had happened in peacetime, Remus would have simply taken himself off to a new place and a new job, so that he did not have to endure the pain of watching Tonks fall in love with a handsome, young wizard in the <a href="/wiki/Auror_Office" title="Auror Office">Auror Office</a> (which was what he expected to happen). However, this was war; they were both needed in the Order of the Phoenix, and nobody knew what the next day would bring. Remus felt justified in remaining exactly where he was, keeping his feelings to himself but secretly rejoicing every time somebody paired him with Tonks on some overnight mission.
</p><p>It had never occurred to Remus that Tonks could return his feelings because he had become so used to considering himself unclean and unworthy. One night when they lay in hiding outside a known Death Eater’s house, after a year of increasingly warm friendship, Tonks made an idle remark about one of their fellow Order members (<i>"He’s still handsome, isn't he, even after Azkaban?</i>"). Before he could stop himself, Remus had replied bitterly that he supposed she had fallen for his old friend ("<i>He always got the women.</i>"). At this, Tonks replied: "<i>You’d know perfectly well who I’ve fallen for, if you weren’t too busy feeling sorry for yourself to notice.</i>"

<p>Remus’s immediate response was a happiness he had never experienced in his life, but this was extinguished almost at once by a sense of crushing duty. He had always known that he could not marry and run the risk of passing on his painful, shameful condition. Wiser than Remus, she was sure that he loved her, but that he was refusing to admit it out of mistaken nobility. However, he avoided working with her, barely talked to her, and started volunteering for the most dangerous missions. Tonks became desperately unhappy, convinced not only that the man she loved would never willingly spend time with her again, but also that he might walk to his death rather than admit his feelings.
</p><p>Inspired by <a href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a>’s protestation of enduring love for <a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill Weasley</a>, who had been savaged by <a href="/wiki/Fenrir_Greyback" title="Fenrir Greyback">Greyback</a>, Tonks made a brave, public declaration of her feelings for Remus, who was forced to admit the strength of his love for her. In spite of continuing misgivings that he was acting selfishly, Remus married Tonks quietly in the north of Scotland, with witnesses taken from the local wizarding tavern. He continued to fear that the stigma attached to him would infect his wife and wished for no fanfare around their union. He swung constantly between elation that he was married to the woman of his dreams and terror of what he might have brought upon them both. When she became pregnant, Remus was not delighted by this, he was in fact scared that he might be passing his condition on to an innocent child. He even attempted to abandon his pregnant wife and unborn child, but was stopped by Harry Potter. Realising the importance of staying with his family above all else, he returned to Tonks, bitterly ashamed.
</p><p>Lupin and Tonks were both murdered in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a> in May 1998, leaving their son behind in the care of his maternal grandmother, <a href="/wiki/Andromeda_Tonks" title="Andromeda Tonks">Andromeda Tonks</a>, and his godfather, Harry Potter. Teddy was raised by Andromeda, but would spend a great deal of time with the <a href="/wiki/Potter_family" title="Potter family">Potter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Weasley_family" title="Weasley family">Weasley</a> families growing up. Teddy was a <a href="/wiki/Metamorphmagus" title="Metamorphmagus">Metamorphmagus</a>, like his mother.

<p>Remus' son was born in <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>. Remus and his wife named him Edward, Teddy for short, after her father <a href="/wiki/Edward_Tonks" title="Edward Tonks">Ted Tonks</a>. At one point, Remus nearly abandoned <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">his wife</a> and unborn son, mostly out of premature shame, guilt, and the fear that his <a href="/wiki/Lycanthropy" title="Lycanthropy">lycanthropy</a> would be passed on and that he'd made outcasts out of Nymphadora and their child. Rather than wanting to face his impending fatherhood, he intended to help <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Weasley" title="Ronald Weasley">Ron</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> with their mission of destroying Voldemort's Horcruxes (though he was actually unaware of what their "mission" entailed). Harry was, however, upset with the development and got into a rather heated argument with Remus that ultimately convinced him that the best course of action would be to support his family. He returned to his wife shortly thereafter.
</p><p>Teddy was eventually born and despite his earlier fears and insecurities about being a father, Remus expressed joy at his son's birth and asked Harry to be Teddy's godfather. Sadly, Remus and his wife were murdered at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, leaving Teddy an orphan when he was between two weeks and one month old. When Remus appeared again through the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Stone" title="Resurrection Stone">Resurrection Stone</a>, he was rather devastated knowing that Teddy would have to grow up without either of his parents, but found some solace in knowing that Teddy would be living in a better world. Teddy was raised by his maternal grandmother, but he spent significant time with his <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">godfather</a>'s family and the Weasleys.

</p><p>At some point, after Remus and his friends had all become members of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, Sirius came to distrust Remus, fearing he might be a spy; the reasons for this are unknown.

<p>Severus Snape, a <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> student in Remus' year, shared a strong enmity with Remus' close friends <a href="/wiki/James_Potter_I" title="James Potter I">James Potter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>, who outright bullied Snape on occasion. Although not friendly with Snape, Remus never behaved cruelly to him. It is possible that he may have subtly identified with or sympathised with the lonely, isolated Snape, seeing a reflection of himself and how he would have been treated if he hadn't found the protection of his friends. Later in life, he said that he deeply regretted not having done anything to stop the bullying.<sup id="cite_ref-OTP_14-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OTP-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>At some point in their fifth year, Snape saw <a href="/wiki/Poppy_Pomfrey" title="Poppy Pomfrey">Madam Pomfrey</a> leading Remus to the passageway on the full moon; Sirius thought it would be entertaining to inform Snape of how to freeze the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Whomping_Willow" title="Hogwarts Whomping Willow">Whomping Willow</a>. Snape tried to do so, but was stopped by James before he could reach the <a href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a>, where Remus had transformed. <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> forbade Snape from revealing Remus' condition to anyone, and Snape deeply resented being put in James' debt and suspected that Remus might have been in on the dangerous prank.
</p><p>As adults, Remus and Snape were civil to one another, although barely so on the latter's part. Remus claimed that he neither liked nor disliked Snape; of course they would never be bosom friends, after all that happened in their school days, but he also never forgot that Snape dutifully made him the Wolfsbane Potion, and made it perfectly every time so that he would not have to suffer at the full moon as he usually did. (Also, Snape secretly saved Lupin's life in <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Seven_Potters" title="Battle of the Seven Potters">Battle over Little Whinging</a>). Snape, on the other hand, barely concealed his bitterness in their interactions. He was irked that Remus obtained the position of <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> <a href="/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">professor</a> at Hogwarts, which he had always wanted for himself. He suspected that Remus was helping Sirius get into the castle and tried to convince Dumbledore to stop trusting him. Snape also took to dropping hints that Remus was a werewolf to students, which was understood by at least one of them (<a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, who kept the discovery to herself). When Remus tried to inform Snape of Sirius' innocence, Snape refused to hear or believe any of it, and was determined to see Remus punished alongside Sirius. When Snape's old enemy escaped re-capture, Snape vindictively exposed Remus' werewolf status, which forced him to resign.<sup id="cite_ref-POA_11-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-POA-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>

</div>
<p>The only real disagreement they ever had was when Harry rejected Remus' offer to accompany him and his friends on the quest for Horcruxes. Harry became angry and cutting; he told his former teacher that he was being selfish and irresponsible for leaving his wife and unborn child. Remus responded with uncharacteristic violence and stormed out of the house, taking refuge in a corner of the Leaky Cauldron, where he sat drinking and fuming. However, after a few hours' reflection, Remus was forced to accept that his former-pupil had just taught him a valuable lesson. James and Lily, Remus reflected, had stuck with Harry even unto their own deaths. His own parents had sacrificed their peace and security to keep the family together. When Remus' son <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">Teddy Lupin</a> was born, he asked that Harry be the boy's godfather, and after Remus' death, Harry played a prominent role in Teddy's life. Remus was one of the spirits that came out of the <a href="/wiki/Resurrection_Stone" title="Resurrection Stone">Resurrection Stone</a> to speak to Harry as he walked to what he believed was his death, indicating the almost familial bond between Remus and Harry.<sup id="cite_ref-DH_31-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DH-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup> This familial bond can be compared to wolf behaviour, as it is common in wolf packs for the pups to be looked after by all members of the pack, much like how Harry was looked after and tutored by his father's friends, who in a way were part of James' "pack". 
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them" title="Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them">Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</a></i>, Harry wrote in the werewolf section "<i>aren't all bad</i>", showing that Remus being a werewolf did not bother him at all.

Although Ron initially reacted with fear to the revelation that Remus was a werewolf, he continued to admire and like Remus.

<p>Albus Dumbledore was considered by many to be the greatest <a href="/wiki/Wizardkind" title="Wizardkind">wizard</a> of all time, and Remus Lupin was among his many admirers and staunch supporters. Dumbledore was Remus' Headmaster during his time at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a>. Dumbledore accepted Remus into his school, despite knowing his being a werewolf, as he valued Remus' strength of character and ability, and disregarded the stigma associated with his condition; the <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">headmaster</a> personally approached the Lupin family to invite Remus to school, knowing full well of the circumstances. In fact, it was Dumbledore who, by several special precautions, ensured that Remus' werewolf status was kept secret during his school years, effectively preventing him from being ostracised from his school mates.

<dd>&#8212;Lupin's respect for Dumbledore<sup class="noprint"><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">[src]</a></sup></dd>

<p>When <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> found out what Remus truly was due to a cruel prank played on him by <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius</a>, Dumbledore was the one who swore him to secrecy. On his part, Remus confessed that Dumbledore's trust and exceptional kindness towards him meant everything to him, given that the vast majority of the wizarding world shunned him because of the deep prejudice towards werewolves, and Remus felt guilty for betraying this kindness by allowing his three <a href="/wiki/Marauders" title="Marauders">Marauder</a> friends illegally become <a href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagi</a> and roaming wild during their schooling years. Despite this, after learning of Sirius's innocence, Dumbledore forgave Remus for his supposed betrayal, understanding his Marauder friends only became Animagi to help Remus in his werewolf form and considered it an extraordinary achievement.
</p><p>Dumbledore was also the founder and leader of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix" title="Order of the Phoenix">Order of the Phoenix</a>, an organisation that Remus joined after graduating from school, and he was trusted with many important missions. Remus was given the position of Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts during the 1993–1994 school year, during which time Dumbledore requested that Snape brew the <a href="/wiki/Wolfsbane_Potion" title="Wolfsbane Potion">Wolfsbane Potion</a> for Remus monthly; this, along with providing Remus with a paid job when he was suffering in poverty due to his condition, made Remus respect Dumbledore even more. Remus and Dumbledore fought alongside one another during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Department_of_Mysteries" title="Battle of the Department of Mysteries">Battle of the Department of Mysteries</a>, where they suffered a devastating loss: Sirius, one of their dearest friends, died at the hands of <a href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a>. Remus told Harry Potter on several occasions that he trusted Snape because Dumbledore did so. In 1997, Remus was devastated by Dumbledore's <a href="/wiki/Death" title="Death">death</a> after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Astronomy_Tower" title="Battle of the Astronomy Tower">Battle of the Astronomy Tower</a>, and demonstrated his loyalty and faith to Dumbledore by fighting and where he was assassinated by Antonin Dolohov a very powerful wizard he was avenged by Professor Filius Flitwick, his former teacher.

He saved George's life, as George would have fallen off his broomstick when he was cursed by <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>. Arthur later thanked him for taking care of his son.
</p><p>Remus also lived for some time with the Weasley family at <a href="/wiki/12_Grimmauld_Place" title="12 Grimmauld Place">12 Grimmauld Place</a>. There, Remus agreed with <a href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly</a> not to tell Harry much about the Order of the Phoenix and Voldemort's plans. However, when Sirius argued with Molly, Remus didn't take either side.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/William_Weasley" title="William Weasley">Bill</a> and Remus seemed to have been friends, as they fought together in several battles of the Second War; they were also the ones who attempted to find <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Mad-Eye</a>'s dead body after the Battle of the Seven Potters. After the war, Remus and Tonks' <a href="/wiki/Edward_Lupin" title="Edward Lupin">son</a> seemed to have a romantic relationship with Bill and Fleur's <a href="/wiki/Victoire_Weasley" title="Victoire Weasley">daughter</a>.
</p><p>Fred and George Weasley were also friends of Lupin. They were Lupin's students during their fifth year at Hogwarts and they also fought together at the Battle of the Seven Potters. Remus protected George from being killed; however, George's ear was accidentally cut off by <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>. Lupin and the twins also appeared on the underground radio programme <i><a href="/wiki/Potterwatch" title="Potterwatch">Potterwatch</a></i> and spoke to the wizarding community during the last year of the war. Both Fred and Lupin were killed during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>.
</p><p>He was also friends with <a href="/wiki/Ginevra_Weasley" title="Ginevra Weasley">Ginny</a>. He first met her at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">Hogwarts Express</a>, saved her from the <a href="/wiki/Dementor" title="Dementor">Dementors</a> and gave her chocolate and comforted her, and she stated that he was one of her favourite professors at Hogwarts.

</p><p>His relationship with <a href="/wiki/Percy_Weasley" title="Percy Weasley">Percy</a> was almost unknown. When Lupin was Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Percy most likely thought he was a good teacher.

<p>When Lupin was a student at Hogwarts, the professors seemed to like him, especially Minerva McGonagall, who had been his head of house. His professors probably considered Lupin a skilled wizard and a very good student, as he was made a <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">prefect</a> in his fifth year.
</p><p>When Lupin became a professor, the other professors appeared to like and respect him, with the exception of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>. They either did not mind that he was a werewolf or did not show it, as they had been informed of his condition. Minerva even made reference to Lupin's evaluations on Harry's Defence Against the Dark Arts skills during a Careers Advice session. Many of them later fought alongside Remus at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>.

While others, such as <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a> and several other <a href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherins</a>, disliked and regularly insulted him. Malfoy underestimated Lupin because of his poor-looking appearance. However, Lupin managed to be well-respected (and one of the best-liked professors), as he treated all the students based on their character, and not by their magical abilities, their blood status, or their wealth. When he left Hogwarts, many students continued to regard him as the best Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher they had.

<ul><li>The name "Remus" comes from the brothers Romulus and Remus, the legendary brothers who fought to the death over the control of Rome, having been raised by a mother wolf whose cubs had died. Because of this, some fans speculated that Remus had a brother, but "Romulus" is merely the code name used by Lupin for <i><a href="/wiki/Potterwatch" title="Potterwatch">Potterwatch</a></i>. Remus' intense rivalry with Romulus indicates Lupin's ongoing struggle with his other side, the werewolf.</li>
<li>"Lupin" is derived from "lupinus", Latin for "wolf-like"; "lupus", or "wolf", being the basic word. <i>Canis l​upus</i> is the scientific name for the wolf - to be described as "lupine" means to "resemble a wolf." Lupin is also the name of an plant with edible seeds. The surname may also be derived from the character of Arsène Lupin, a fictional gentleman thief and master of disguise, who was created by French writer Maurice Leblanc in 1905. In Leblanc's novels, Arsène Lupin is often a force for good, while operating on the wrong side of the law. Leblanc's Lupin was said to have later inspired the character of "the Lone Wolf", a jewel thief-turned-private detective in a series of novels written by Louis Joseph Vance, beginning in 1914.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Remus Lupin being a werewolf could have been predicted merely by his name. Remus is from a roman story about two demigod/prince brothers, <b>Remus</b> and, the founder of Rome, Romulus, who were raised by a <b>wolf</b>. Lupin is a take on the Latin word for wolf, <i>lupus.</i></li>
<li>Remus Lupin is unique among the teachers as he calls students per their first names, not surnames. The only other teachers that are known to do this is the <a href="/wiki/Headmaster" title="Headmaster">Headmaster</a> <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Care_of_Magical_Creatures" title="Care of Magical Creatures">Care of Magical Creatures</a> <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">professor</a>.</li>
<li>Remus Lupin is the only <a href="/wiki/Marauders" title="Marauders">Marauder</a> to be on anything resembling civil terms with <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> as adults. <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius</a> and Snape had often argued as adults. <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pettigrew" title="Peter Pettigrew">Pettigrew</a> was treated with contempt by Snape, going so far into being treated as a house servant at Snape's personal residence at <a href="/wiki/Spinner%27s_End" title="Spinner&#39;s End">Spinner's End</a>.</li>
<li>With his marriage to <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a>, Remus became related through his wife to the Malfoys, the Blacks, the Lestranges, the Weasleys, the Potters, the Longbottoms, and other pure-blood families.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">&#91;41&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The Marauders write their names on the Marauder's Map in this order: Remus, Peter, Sirius and James. Ironically, this, when reversed, is the order in which they die, James being the first in <a href="/wiki/1981" title="1981">1981</a>, <a href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric&#39;s Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a>; Sirius in <a href="/wiki/1996" title="1996">1996</a>, <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Mysteries" title="Department of Mysteries">Department of Mysteries</a>; Peter in <a href="/wiki/March" title="March">March</a> <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, <a href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a>; Remus in <a href="/wiki/May" title="May">May</a> <a href="/wiki/1998" title="1998">1998</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>.
<ul><li>Remus survived the longest out of all the Marauders, beating Wormtail by some chapters in <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</a></i>.</li></ul></li>
<li>After the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Seven_Potters" title="Battle of the Seven Potters">Battle of the Seven Potters</a>, 13 people (Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill, Fleur, Fred, George, Ron, Ginny, Harry, Hermione, Remus, Tonks and Hagrid) gathered in <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">The Burrow</a> to mourn the death of <a href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor Moody</a>. Afterwards, Remus stood up and offered to look for Moody's dead body. Later in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Hogwarts" title="Battle of Hogwarts">Battle of Hogwarts</a>, Remus was killed by <a href="/wiki/Antonin_Dolohov" title="Antonin Dolohov">Antonin Dolohov</a> thus making another of <a href="/wiki/Sybill_Trelawney" title="Sybill Trelawney">Trelawney</a>'s predictions come true for the third time (first time on <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, and second on <a href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>)&#160;: that <i>when thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die</i>. However, as it is not known when Remus died, it is possible that Fred died before him.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> wrote a full-length biography of Remus for <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i> on  <i><a href="/wiki/Pottermore" title="Pottermore">Pottermore</a></i>, which was released in the final instalment of the book, and provided information on his and <a href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a>'s relationship, as well as his youth.<sup id="cite_ref-IN_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-IN-42">&#91;42&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Remus is portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Great_Britain" title="Great Britain">British</a> actor <a href="/wiki/David_Thewlis" title="David Thewlis">David Thewlis</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)" title="Harry Potter (film series)">film adaptations</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">Order of the Phoenix</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">Half-Blood Prince</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1">Deathly Hallows: Part 1</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_2" title="Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2">Part 2</a></i>.
<ul><li>Thewlis had originally auditioned for the part of <a href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Professor Quirinus Quirrell</a>, but <a href="/wiki/Ian_Hart" title="Ian Hart">Ian Hart</a> was eventually cast.</li>
<li>David Thewlis has said that <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)">Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i> director <a href="/wiki/Alfonso_Cuar%C3%B3n" title="Alfonso Cuarón">Alfonso Cuaron</a> told him to portray Remus as a "gay junkie".<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">&#91;43&#93;</a></sup></li></ul></li>
<li>In the books, Remus plays a relatively large part in Harry's life after he left Hogwarts as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. However, in the films, Remus plays a large part in <i>Prisoner of Azkaban</i>, and then his role is drastically reduced. His argument and brief falling out with Harry in <i>Deathly Hallows</i> is cut out, as is his bitterness at being a father. The audience is not made aware of Remus' child until a throwaway line in <i>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</i>. <i>Half-Blood Prince</i> also cuts down his role, eliminating Remus' concerns about being in a relationship with Tonks.
<ul><li>David Thewlis was disappointed about his smaller appearances in the films, expressing a desire to be more involved.</li></ul></li>
<li>Originally, Remus and Nymphadora were supposed to survive the Battle of Hogwarts, but Rowling eventually killed them off as compensation after sparing <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> from the death, as he was originally intended to die in either the fifth book or the seventh book.</li>
<li>The <a href="/wiki/Trolley_witch" title="Trolley witch">witch who pushes the lunch trolley</a>, Remus, and <a href="/wiki/Horace_Slughorn" title="Horace Slughorn">Horace Slughorn</a> are the only adults ever to be seen travelling to Hogwarts on the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express" title="Hogwarts Express">school train</a> in the book <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(book_series)" title="Harry Potter (book series)">series</a> (the latter is never shown on the train in the films). Though the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts_Express_conductor" title="Hogwarts Express conductor">conductor</a> is never shown in the books, he is seen in some of the video game adaptations.</li>
<li>It was predicted by many fans that Wormtail would kill Remus with his silver hand, as Remus is a werewolf. However, J.K. Rowling mentioned in an interview that, contrary to what is seen in films, in her view werewolves are not affected by silver. Ironically the Marauder that does die by the silver hand is not Lupin, but Wormtail himself.</li>
<li>In the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">film adaptation</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</a></i>, Remus and Nymphadora were already in a relationship, rather then Remus initially rejecting her feelings since during the Christmas scene at <a href="/wiki/The_Burrow" title="The Burrow">The Burrow</a> she calls him "sweetheart".</li>
<li>In an earlier draft of <i><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban" title="Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a></i>, the <a href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> class may have been taught by a woman.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">&#91;44&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>His name is the inspiration for the <a href="/wiki/Wizard_rock" title="Wizard rock">wizard rock</a> bands <a href="/wiki/Remus_and_the_Lupins" title="Remus and the Lupins">Remus and the Lupins</a> and <a href="/wiki/The_Remus_Lupins" title="The Remus Lupins">The Remus Lupins</a>.</li>
<li>According to StarDate Online's Moon Phase Calculator, Remus' birth date (10 March, 1960), fell two days before a full moon.</li>
<li>Although Remus provides most of the books' information on the Patronus Charm, his own Patronus was never revealed in any of the books or media associated with the franchise until the release of the final chapters of <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i> on  <i><a href="/wiki/Pottermore" title="Pottermore">Pottermore</a></i>. His corporeal Patronus takes the form of a <a href="/wiki/Wolf" title="Wolf">wolf</a>, rather than a werewolf. Despite this, he normally preferred to purposely cast it as a non-corporeal form, as he considered the corporeal form to be too much of a giveaway.<sup id="cite_ref-PM_1-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PM-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>J. K. Rowling has indirectly stated that, if Remus Lupin were to take a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Myers–Briggs Type Indicator">Myers–Briggs Type Indicator</a> assessment, his personality type would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENFJ" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:ENFJ">ENFJ</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">&#91;45&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>The irony of his status as a werewolf and his desire to be liked and belong is that wolves are social animals that tend to live in packs and act in the interests of all, reflecting his selfless and self-sacrificing nature. This, combined with the typically savage side of his werewolf forms presents an almost yin-yang-like inner conflict, with his human form representing the better half of his wolfish personality, such as his intelligence, kindness, adaptability, and desire to defend. All the while his werewolf form represents the more savage aspects of wolves, such as feral wrath, gluttony, and lust.
<ul><li>Another bit of irony is in his love of chocolate, as it is poisonous to wolves and other canines.</li></ul></li>
<li>In the films Remus is shown to be a fan of jazz music, and owns an antique record player.</li>
<li>Remus' tendency to nurture those around him, particularly children, is fitting, as wolves' social structure commonly involves all members of the pack looking after and teaching the pups. Yet another instance where Remus lives up to the nobler aspects of his wolfish nature. Rather ironically, he considered himself unfit for parenthood.</li>
<li>Lupin was Harry's only Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher who was not antagonistic to him. (Not including when Lupin tried attacking him in his werewolf form).</li></ul>

<p><a href="/wiki/J._K._Rowling" title="J. K. Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> has stated that Professor Lupin is the kind of teacher she wishes she had while she was a student. He is good-natured, kind, and able to extract the best in everyone — for example, in spotting <a href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>'s lack of confidence and helping him to overcome it by teaching him how to defeat the <a href="/wiki/Boggart" title="Boggart">boggart</a>.
</p><p>The fact that Remus is a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a> and needs to take a <a href="/wiki/Wolfsbane_Potion" title="Wolfsbane Potion">potion</a> to avoid hurting people for the rest of his life makes him a symbol of the consequences of prejudice and segregation, as well as society's often negative reaction to the ill and the disabled. Particularly, the author has stated that Remus Lupin's characterisation and history are H.I.V. metaphors (e.g. someone who was infected young and suffered prejudice because of it; terrified of passing the condition on), as well as an exploration into why someone might become embittered as a result of contracting such a condition.<sup id="cite_ref-legal_46-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-legal-46">&#91;46&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>As such, Rowling has also stated that "Lupin's failing is he likes to be liked. That's where he slips up — he's been disliked so often he's always pleased to have friends so cuts them an awful lot of slack."<sup id="cite_ref-JKR_40-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-JKR-40">&#91;40&#93;</a></sup> This is why, for instance, despite disapproving of his friends' bullying of <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a>, he once tried to stop them but failed and never tried again.
</p><p>Lupin was killed off in place of Arthur Weasley to remove the last of Harry's father figures in the books, and also to create a parallel between Harry's life and Teddy Lupin's. Rowling felt it was important to show the evils of Voldemort's actions and the devastating nature of war.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">&#91;47&#93;</a></sup> She says she only decided to kill Remus at the end of the fifth book.
</p><p>Rowling has said that Remus is one of her favourite characters, and that if she could meet any of her characters, she would likely choose him.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">&#91;48&#93;</a></sup>
