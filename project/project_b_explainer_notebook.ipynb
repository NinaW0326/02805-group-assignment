    "\n",
    "Our dataset is the characters from Harry Potter Novel, including character relationships, character attributes, characer stories.\n",
    "We got the dataset using API from Fandom pages. Also, J.K rolling’s books will be used as our data source as well.    \n",

    "some limitations: the potential problems of this dataset)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why we choose this dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "**First of all**, this dataset has a very complete structure of character relations, which is a perfct material for social network analysis.\n",
    "**Moreover**, there are some particularly interesting studies of the relationship between universes, such as those between wizards and Muggles (non-wizards), from which we hope to derive the new X-degree of separation for whole universe.\n",
    "**Also**, the division of the four major colleges systems within the Hogwarts also caught our attention, and we wanted to find the attributes and patterns so that everyone could know which house they were assigned to.\n",
    "**Finally**, the Harry Potter novel accompanies almost everyone's childhood, most of people are very familiar with the characters and stories, hence, it will be easier to understand the outcomes of our exploration. And it would be exciting to explore new discoveries from familiar stories and relationships.\n",

    "View the social network structure of the characters.\n",
    "Get the basic statistics of the social network, such as how many characters involved (nodes), how many relationships they have (links) and so on.\n",
    "Understand the social network node attributes and corresponding social network structures (For instance: Four colleges; Muggle world& Wizarding World, Dark magic& Good Wizard).\n",
    "Follow the community detection of the social network (four colleges in Hogwarts) and be able to see how the generated community detections differs from the original allocation result.\n",
    "Know the keywords for each community.\n",
    "From clustering the sentiment detection/analysis of the characters, understand the general emotional tone of the characters in the book.\n",

    "3. 哈利波特世界中人物的情感分析。\n",
    "作为一个儿童读物，哈利波特中的人物具有鲜明的性格特点和感情倾向，我们很好奇，哪些人物更积极、开心；而哪些人物更加的阴郁、低落？同时我们也相对四个学院的社区进行这样的检测。\n",

    "4. 利用文本信息的社区检测。\n",
    "在社区检测方法中，权重值一直被我们所忽略。事实上，在人物A和B，C均认识的情况下，他们之间的关系紧密的强弱并不相同。我们利用文本信息，设计两个节点之间边的权重，再进行社区检测算法。我们将此算法应用在霍格沃兹学院内，讲通过算法产生的分隔与分院帽的结果进行对比，分析之间的不同并探索how smart the sorting hat is.\n",

    "5. 预测分院结果。\n",
    "输入一段文字描述，你将会被分到哪一个学院呢？我们希望可以将之前在网络中学习到知识与ML相结合，让哈迷们体验一下自己与哪个学院的特质更相近。"
